Living the Artist's Life,"This is an engrossing yet practical guidebook for artists that has been endorsed by the Rhode Island School of Design, and seven other major universities.

As an artist 'living the artist's life' this book has been a gold mine of information, dos and don'ts, and general reference for any artist out there trying to make a living from his/her craft. Paul Dorrell is a writer and gallery owner and his life's experiences and struggles are meshed into the life's of many artists.This book deserves the attention of all artists: writers, painters, performers who are all out there trying to make it. It was comforting on one hand to know there are many like myself taking the same directions, and yet a little scary to know others have gone the same paths as I have.Any artist full of doubts, depressions, rejections, and wondering where they go from here; read this book and use it as your daily bible.

A Thematic Guide to Optimality Theory (Research Surveys in Linguistics),Explains and explores the central premises of OT and the results of their praxis.,['John J. McCarthy'],Cambridge University Press,2002,['Language Arts & Disciplines'],1.0,4.0,2005-08-19,excellent,"About me: I'm in molecular biology. I read this book because I was interested in if and how ""Optimality Theory"" manages to capture and explain the phenomena of structural complexity and structural diversity in language. I can only review the book from my ""outsider"" position.I think Optimality Theory in its simplicity and brilliance rivals the Theory of Evolution. It will not become as widely popular, because its formulation is more complex, but its impact in linguistics will equal the impact of evolutionary theory in biology. (Actually I think OT is more interesting than TToE, because it explains the underlying structure and emerging laws rather than limiting itself to describe what happens on the surface.)I think John McCarthy does a very good job in explaining its basic principles. The examples are (necessarily) taken from phonology and sometimes syntax. I didn't understand all of them in great detail (as I said I'm not a linguist), but I understood all the principles, which was all I wanted.I recommend this book to people who are interested in linguistics, or in complexity in general. (Obviously I'm in no position to assess for example whether it would be a good study guide for students of linguistics.)",3,3
Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance : An Inquiry Into Values,"THE CLASSIC BOOK THAT HAS INSPIRED MILLIONS A penetrating examination of how we live and how to live better Few books transform a generation and then establish themselves as touchstones for the generations that follow. Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance is one such book. This modern epic of a man’s search for meaning became an instant bestseller on publication in 1974, acclaimed as one of the most exciting books in the history of American letters. It continues to inspire millions. A narration of a summer motorcycle trip undertaken by a father and his son, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance becomes a personal and philosophical odyssey into fundamental questions on how to live. The narrator's relationship with his son leads to a powerful self-reckoning; the craft of motorcycle maintenance leads to an austerely beautiful process for reconciling science, religion, and humanism. Resonant with the confusions of existence, this classic is a touching and transcendent book of life. This new edition contains an interview with Pirsig and letters and documents detailing how this extraordinary book came to be.",['Robert M. Pirsig'],Harper Collins,2009,['Philosophy'],3618.0,3.0,1998-10-13,problematical to assess,"This book is among the most problematical for me to assess. On the one hand, it seemed overwhelmingly &quot;honest&quot; to me when I first read it. On the other hand, I've read a great deal of philosophy since then, and the initial book now seems trivial by comparison. The book at least provides stimulus to a reader's thoughts, but then once the reader has grown, he may disavow the original catalyst. The book is too serious for the general reader but too lightweight for a serious student of philosophy. The narrative of the cross-country motorcycle trip is alternately compelling and lackluster. The tone and style of writing is colloquial, which may or may not agree with the reader. Overall, then, I give the book a three-star rating, mainly on account of its quality to stimulate the general reader (and it is the general reader to whom the book is addressed) into thinking about metaphysics and modern society.",4,6
The Falcon and the Flower,"Astride her white palfrey, surrounded by a nimbus of silver-blond hair, Jasmine was a vision to strike a man mute with desire. But the violet-eyed love child of King Richard's half brother had vowed that no man would ever rule her heart. Until she saw the face of the Devil himself in her crystal ball--the dark, brooding knight who would kill to make her his own. She would risk a dissolute court and a maddened, lustful king to keep destiny at bay, anything to keep her from the hypnotic eyes and burning caresses of...The Falcon. A wickedly handsome warrior who lived by blood and the sword, Falcon de Burgh wanted to wed no woman--until he laid eyes on the exquisite Jasmine, and he vowed to possess her, to teach her all the wondrous ways a man could love a woman, no matter what it might take to conquer her fiery, unyielding heart.

I loved The Marriage Prize. As with that book, this one contained wonderful, fascinating historical facts and a story that I couldn't put down. My only complaint was that Jasmine was so unlikeable.

If you can put up with a herione like that, the book was well-written and the story comes to a satisfying ending.",6,6
Frankenstein (Running Press classics),A scientist assembles a monster from parts of deadbodies which develops a mind of his own as he learns to loathe himself and his creator.,['Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley'],Running Press Book Publishers,1990,['Frankenstein (Fictitious character)'],1083.0,5.0,2007-06-18,Greatest Story Ever Told,"Sorry to you religious types, but this novel describes the human condition more powerfully than any ""spiritual"" tome. To say that it is about responsibility, scientific as well as parental, would be true but also misleading as to the true depth of the work. Like some greek tragedy, there are no truly evil characters in this story. Both Victor Frankenstein and his creation are the victims of their own personalities. Destiny or psychology? Ponder the creature's emotionally wrought story well, for it describes perfectly the psychology of a terrorist who is a human being with family, not some inhuman monster, who strikes out at those he perceives as uncaring to his real or imagined wrongs suffered at the hands of others. Many forget that this was a horror story. Though the creature started out innocent, in the last third of the novel it has matured into a destructive force. And what a force! It haunts Frankenstein like some demonic monkey on his back, stalking him and killing his loved ones while Frankenstein is unable to expose him to the world without admitting his complicity in the creature's existence, even if he were to be believed. At one point, he ends up in an insane asylum. The novel starts with Frankenstein's obsession to create life, and ends with his obsession to destroy what he has created. A timeless portrait of the human condition in all its wretchedness.",3,5
Joy of Cooking,"“Cooking shouldn’t just be about making a delicious dish—owning the process and enjoying the experience ought to be just as important as the meal itself. The new Joy of Cooking is a reminder that nothing can compare to gathering around the table for a home cooked meal with the people who matter most.” —Joanna Gaines, author of Magnolia Table “Generation after generation, Joy has been a warm, encouraging presence in American kitchens, teaching us to cook with grace and humor. This luminous new edition continues on that important tradition while seamlessly weaving in modern touches, making it all the more indispensable for generations to come.” —Samin Nosrat, author of Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat In the nearly ninety years since Irma S. Rombauer self-published the first three thousand copies of Joy of Cooking in 1931, it has become the kitchen bible, with more than 20 million copies in print. This new edition of Joy has been thoroughly revised and expanded by Irma’s great-grandson John Becker and his wife, Megan Scott. John and Megan developed more than six hundred new recipes for this edition, tested and tweaked thousands of classic recipes, and updated every section of every chapter to reflect the latest ingredients and techniques available to today’s home cooks. Their strategy for revising this edition was the same one Irma and Marion employed: Vet, research, and improve Joy’s coverage of legacy recipes while introducing new dishes, modern cooking techniques, and comprehensive information on ingredients now available at farmers’ markets and grocery stores. You will find tried-and-true favorites like Banana Bread Cockaigne, Chocolate Chip Cookies, and Southern Corn Bread—all retested and faithfully improved—as well as new favorites like Chana Masala, Beef Rendang, Megan’s Seeded Olive Oil Granola, and Smoked Pork Shoulder. In addition to a thoroughly modernized vegetable chapter, there are many more vegan and vegetarian recipes, including Caramelized Tamarind Tempeh, Crispy Pan-Fried Tofu, Spicy Chickpea Soup, and Roasted Mushroom Burgers. Joy’s baking chapters now include gram weights for accuracy, along with a refreshed lineup of baked goods like Cannelés de Bordeaux, Rustic No-Knead Sourdough, Ciabatta, Chocolate-Walnut Babka, and Chicago-Style Deep-Dish Pizza, as well as gluten-free recipes for pizza dough and yeast breads. A new chapter on streamlined cooking explains how to economize time, money, and ingredients and avoid waste. You will learn how to use a diverse array of ingredients, from amaranth to za’atar. New techniques include low-temperature and sous vide cooking, fermentation, and cooking with both traditional and electric pressure cookers. Barbecuing, smoking, and other outdoor cooking methods are covered in even greater detail. This new edition of Joy is the perfect combination of classic recipes, new dishes, and indispensable reference information for today’s home cooks. Whether it is the only cookbook on your shelf or one of many, Joy is and has been the essential and trusted guide for home cooks for almost a century. This new edition continues that legacy.","['Irma S.

Slaughterhouse-Five,"A special fiftieth anniversary edition of Kurt Vonnegut’s masterpiece, “a desperate, painfully honest attempt to confront the monstrous crimes of the twentieth century” (Time), featuring a new introduction by Kevin Powers, author of the National Book Award finalist The Yellow Birds Selected by the Modern Library as one of the 100 best novels of all time Slaughterhouse-Five, an American classic, is one of the world’s great antiwar books. Centering on the infamous World War II firebombing of Dresden, the novel is the result of what Kurt Vonnegut described as a twenty-three-year struggle to write a book about what he had witnessed as an American prisoner of war. It combines historical fiction, science fiction, autobiography, and satire in an account of the life of Billy Pilgrim, a barber’s son turned draftee turned optometrist turned alien abductee. As Vonnegut had, Billy experiences the destruction of Dresden as a POW. Unlike Vonnegut, he experiences time travel, or coming “unstuck in time.” An instant bestseller, Slaughterhouse-Five made Kurt Vonnegut a cult hero in American literature, a reputation that only strengthened over time, despite his being banned and censored by some libraries and schools for content and language. But it was precisely those elements of Vonnegut’s writing—the political edginess, the genre-bending inventiveness, the frank violence, the transgressive wit—that have inspired generations of readers not just to look differently at the world around them but to find the confidence to say something about it. Authors as wide-ranging as Norman Mailer, John Irving, Michael Crichton, Tim O’Brien, Margaret Atwood, Elizabeth Strout, David Sedaris, Jennifer Egan, and J. K. Rowling have all found inspiration in Vonnegut’s words. Jonathan Safran Foer has described Vonnegut as “the kind of writer who made people—young people especially—want to write.” George Saunders has declared Vonnegut to be “the great, urgent, passionate American writer of our century, who offers us . . . a model of the kind of compassionate thinking that might yet save us from ourselves.” Fifty years after its initial publication at the height of the Vietnam War, Vonnegut's portrayal of political disillusionment, PTSD, and postwar anxiety feels as relevant, darkly humorous, and profoundly affecting as ever, an enduring beacon through our own era’s uncertainties. “Poignant and hilarious, threaded with compassion and, behind everything, the cataract of a thundering moral statement.”—The Boston Globe",['Kurt Vonnegut'],Dial Press Trade Paperback,1999,['Fiction'],1523.0,3.0,1999-10-03,"The novel was okay, but I found it hard to follow","I thought the anti-war theme was very good. It reminds you of how bad war really is. I'm only 17 so I havn't ever experinced a real war. I think that movies and shows today do to much to glorify war, but this book does a great job of making you realize what war is like. One think I did not like was all the time traveling and the whole alien thing. I found it to be confusing and stupid. Other than that I liked the book.",0,1
"23 Minutes In Hell: One Man's Story About What He Saw, Heard, and Felt in that Place of Torment","New York Times Best Seller and Over 1 million copies sold! Over 750 5-Star reviews Wiese’s visit to the devil’s lair lasted just twenty-three minutes, but he returned with vivid details etched in his memory, capturing the attention of national media, including the Christian Broadcasting Network, Daystar Television Network, Trinity Broadcasting Network, the Miracle Channel, Sid Roth’s It’s Supernatural!, Sean Hannity’s America, Charisma News, and many others. Bill Wiese experienced something so horrifying it continues to captivate the world. He saw the searing flames of hell, felt total isolation, smelled the putrid and rotting stench, heard deafening screams of agony, and experienced terrorizing demons. Finally the strong hand of God lifted him out of the pit. Now Wiese shares his insights on commonly asked questions such as: Is hell a literal burning place? Where is hell? Do you have a body in hell? Are there degrees of punishment in hell? Are there children in hell? Can demons torment people in hell?

Confessions of a Sociopathic Social Climber: The Katya Livingston Chronicles,"After weasel-eyed tax inspectors question her work-related claims, Katya Livingston is forced to keep a financial diary. As well as documenting the cruel and parsimonious ways of her ad agency boss, Katya waxes lyrical about putting up with loser friends, mortal enemies, and thoroughly bad restaurants. She also throws in a completely candid account of her love life, just in case some of it is tax deductible. What begins as a private account of expenses rapidly becomes, through Katya's chronic delusions of grandeur, a matter of public record: first as a tawdry gossip column, then as a salacious book, and finally as a Hollywood B-movie. Bitingly written with wit and style reminiscent of Candace Bushnell, Adèle Lang's Confessions of a Sociopathic Social Climber is a cutting, bitchy, hilarious take on the young-single-British-woman genre.",['Adele Lang'],Macmillan,2014,['Fiction'],11.0,2.0,2006-02-11,"Some crass fun, but a seriously flawed humorous novel","If you want to thrill vicariously to the wicked thoughts of a caricature shallow English career woman, this book has some good chuckles. Men are humiliated, women rivals are defeated, friends and family are exploited and cast aside, cute little animals are thoughtlessly murdered, and all business contacts are left to wallow in failure.The trouble is the thing has no plot, none of the characters are remotely sympathetic or believable, and it's just too darned long. As a result, it's funny enough for the first few chapters, but there's a point where you realize it's just going to meander and repeat similar gags forever. Even if you like this sort of crass humor, you look to see how much longer you have to go and wonder if you should bother to finish it. Would have been great as a short story or novelette.",0,1
A Prayer for Owen Meany (Franklin Library Signed First Edition),"'A work of genius' Independent 'Marvellously funny . . .

If you're lucky enough to find a way of life you love, you have to find the courage to live it.' Summer, 1953. In the small town of Gravesend, New Hampshire, eleven-year-old John Wheelwright and his best friend Owen Meany are playing in a Little League baseball game.

My Friend Leonard,"Perhaps the most unconventional and literally breathtaking father-son story you'll ever read, My Friend Leonard pulls you immediately and deeply into a relationship as unusual as it is inspiring. The father figure is Leonard, the high-living, recovering coke addict ""West Coast Director of a large Italian-American finance firm"" (read: mobster) who helped to keep James Frey clean in A Million Little Pieces. The son is, of course, James, damaged perhaps beyond repair by years of crack and alcohol addiction-and by more than a few cruel tricks of fate. James embarks on his post-rehab existence in Chicago emotionally devastated, broke, and afraid to get close to other people. But then Leonard comes back into his life, and everything changes. Leonard offers his ""son"" lucrative—if illegal and slightly dangerous—employment. He teaches James to enjoy life, sober, for the first time. He instructs him in the art of ""living boldly,"" pushes him to pursue his passion for writing, and provides a watchful and supportive veil of protection under which James can get his life together. Both Leonard's and James's careers flourish…but then Leonard vanishes. When the reasons behind his mysterious absence are revealed, the book opens up in unexpected emotional ways. My Friend Leonard showcases a brilliant and energetic young writer rising to important new challenges—displaying surprising warmth, humor, and maturity—without losing his intensity. This book proves that one of the most provocative literary voices of his generation is also one of the most emphatically human.",['James Frey'],Penguin,2005,['Biography & Autobiography'],35.0,5.0,2005-07-01,Another fantastic effort!,"Well done, James Frey!

A good book, but not as outstanding as","the author's first book ""The 10 natural laws of time and life management"" which got a better balance of strategies and tactics.According to page 66, the primary objective of the book is to help readers close the gap between what they really value and what they are doing, which the author describe as the most excruciating kind of pain. Along such, the author ""prescribed"" : ""Burn it into memory. Wake up each morning and ask yourself, ""What am I going to do today to close the gap between what I am doing and what really matters most to me?"""" In my opinion, the author had been very successful in achieving his goal. This is a very enjoyable book under the author's very good writing skill. I might have rated it a five star if I had not read ""The 10 natural laws"" before this.Below please find some passages I love for your reference. Hope you can have a better grasp of the strengths of this book.Page 64: Why New Year Resolutions don't work? Part of the problem is that we have the cart before the horse. We think that by simply setting out a few vague goals, behavior changes will miraculously happen. Setting goals is important and necessary, but it's not the place to begin. My suggestion is that you delay writing resolutions until you have identified your governing values, those things in life that matter most to you, those things without which you would find life meaningless or unfulfilling, those things that lie at heart of who you are and who you hope to become.Pg 150: The most effective tool I have discovered in whipping the demons is to have regular victories in my life every single day. When you do something right, take a moment and savor the feeling. Even a little victory does wonders for your confidence and motivation. Make a conscious effort to successfully complete some task each day related to something that really matters to you. That'll help keep the demons at bay.Pg 151: There are many types of diseases that afflict the human body, and we spend millions and perhaps billions of dollars trying to find cures. But there is one disease of epidemic proportions in our society on which we spend little or no money or effort - the crippling disease called fear of failure.Pg 153: There is a wonderful story about a very successful entrepreneur who was asked why he was so successful. His response was ""Good decisions."" The second question was ""Well, how do you make good decisions?"" The response,: ""Experience."" And then the final question: ""How do you get experience?"" And the response:""Bad decisions.""",21,21

Robb'],Penguin,1995,['Fiction'],137.0,2.0,2009-04-09,Couldn't finish it,"For the sake of variety, I needed something to read in between David Baldacci novels, and this promised mystery, suspense, action, and the like. Needless to say, it delivered none of this, but instead bore me to death for 160-some pages before I gave up, threw the book against the wall and went back to reading worthy authors.Let's go over the many problems here, starting with the main character, I think her name is Eve but honestly I don't remember. She's this by-the-book, uptight, unkempt cop who cares nothing for the standards or modern society or beauty, and yet somehow manages to be beautiful enough that EVERY male character introduced first tries to hit on her. This is so cliche and doesn't make any sense. Second, we have Roarke or whatever his name is. He's a multi-millionaire with everything he could ever want, and every women in the world wants him, yet somehow he finds Eve to be the one that he can't live without.The mystery is really just a sub-plot to a horrible romance novel, but even it isn't very good. Some guy decides it'd be fun to go off popping 6 hookers, which apparently is legal in the future, which brings me to my next point. This is supposed to be futuristic, and to compensate JD Robb invented some lame new stuff to make it seem so, like laser-guns and finger print supressing spray. However, it just so happens that our killer is an ""old schooler"" who uses guns instead of lasers, so in reality, it's not REALLY a futuristic mystery.Even so, the investigation doesn't take long to deteriorate into a bunch of faux romance and unneeded sex scenes. After the third one, literally back to back to back, followed by the cheesy dialogue ""Stopping a police officer from leaving is a crime, I could arrest you,"" and then ""You weren't wearing you badge when it happened, or anything else for what matter.""Seriously??? Skip over this book, it's garbage. 2 stars for whatever the ending might have been.",17,20
The First Circle,"The thrilling cold war masterwork by the nobel prize winner, published in full for the first time Moscow, Christmas Eve, 1949.The Soviet secret police intercept a call made to the American embassy by a Russian diplomat who promises to deliver secrets about the nascent Soviet Atomic Bomb program. On that same day, a brilliant mathematician is locked away inside a Moscow prison that houses the country's brightest minds. He and his fellow prisoners are charged with using their abilities to sleuth out the caller's identity, and they must choose whether to aid Joseph Stalin's repressive state—or refuse and accept transfer to the Siberian Gulag camps . . . and almost certain death. First written between 1955 and 1958, In the First Circle is Solzhenitsyn's fiction masterpiece. In order to pass through Soviet censors, many essential scenes—including nine full chapters—were cut or altered before it was published in a hastily translated English edition in 1968. Now with the help of the author's most trusted translator, Harry T. Willetts, here for the first time is the complete, definitive English edition of Solzhenitsyn's powerful and magnificent classic.",['Aleksandr I.

Not exactly. The same text as ""In the First Circle"" was published in France in 2007 as ""Le Premier Cercle"".More importantly, the publishers claim that the previous English version of ""The First Circle"" was ""bowdlerized"", not ""authentic"" and by implication, polluted by Solzhenitsyn's revisions when he attempted to get the book published in the Soviet Union. This is very misleading.Solzhenitsyn prepared two versions of this novel while writing in Russia in the 1960s. The version now called ""In the First Circle"", just published in English, was 9 short chapters longer and had a different opening plot line from ""The First Circle"", which he edited to 87 chapters and unsuccessfully attempted to publish in the Soviet Union.In that editing, Solzhenitsyn, genius that he was, crafted a far more powerful opening. That's the major difference between the two versions of the novel.""In the First Circle"" (the newly published version) has a young Soviet diplomat, Innokenty Volodin, call the US Embassy in Moscow to warn about a Soviet spy operation in New York related to nuclear military secrets. As such, Innokenty is a 1 in 100 million superman hero (or traitorous villain) who cannot represent ordinary people that lack the ability or the opportunity for such an act.In ""The First Circle"" (already available in English), the same Innokenty also makes a covert call, but to a Russian scientist who as a medical doctor, had earlier treated Innokenty's mother, to warn him against sending some promised scientific samples to colleagues in France, because that act would be considered traitorous and get the scientist arrested.Even that simple warning call was enough to cause the hunting and arrest of Innokenty himself. With this simple opening story, Solzhenitsyn shows how an ordinary man who acts out of basic humanity gets entrapped by the vicious Soviet political environment. This gets us, readers, deeply engaged because we can easily identify with Innokenty's feelings and his action. And because we sympathize with an ordinary person who becomes entangled through such a normal act, it's deeply credible and far more powerful than the extreme scenario of ""In the First Circle"".Therefore, ""The First Circle"" is the true masterpiece version of this novel.This is an unforgettable story about ""conditions where only courage, strength of character, and loyalty to friends made a man and could decide the fate of a comrade."" (""The First Circle"", Ch. 61.)Take a look at ""The First Circle"", the original, and decide for yourself. Regrettably, this masterpiece is out of print in English, but copies of the great translation by Michael Guybon are available inexpensively at used book websites such as Abebooks.",6,6

The Pilot's Wife,"Anita Shreve's hauntingly beautiful #1 bestseller and Oprah's Book Club selection about tragedy, grief, betrayal, and the 'impossibility of knowing another person.' As a pilot's wife, Kathryn has learned to expect both intense exhilaration and long periods alone, but nothing has prepared her for a late-night knock that lets her know her husband has died in a crash. Until now, Kathryn Lyons's life has been peaceful if unextraordinary: a satisfying job teaching high school in the New England mill town of her childhood; a picture-perfect home by the ocean; a precocious, independent-minded fifteen-year-old daughter; and a happy marriage whose occasional dull passages she attributes to the unavoidable deadening of time. As Kathryn struggles with her grief, she descends into a maelstrom of publicity stirred up by the modern hunger for the details of tragedy. Even before the plane is located in waters off the Irish coast, the relentless scrutiny of her husband's life begins to bring a bizarre personal mystery into focus.

What's Going on in There?: How the Brain and Mind Develop in the First Five Years of Life,"As a research neuroscientist, Lise Eliot has made the study of the human brain her life's work. But it wasn't until she was pregnant with her first child that she became intrigued with the study of brain development. She wanted to know precisely how the baby's brain is formed, and when and how each sense, skill, and cognitive ability is developed. And just as important, she was interested in finding out how her role as a nurturer can affect this complex process. How much of her baby's development is genetically ordained--and how much is determined by environment? Is there anything parents can do to make their babies' brains work better--to help them become smarter, happier people? Drawing upon the exploding research in this field as well as the stories of real children, What's Going On in There? is a lively and thought-provoking book that charts the brain's development from conception through the critical first five years. In examining the many factors that play crucial roles in that process, What's Going On in There? explores the evolution of the senses, motor skills, social and emotional behaviors, and mental functions such as attention, language, memory, reasoning, and intelligence. This remarkable book also discusses: how a baby's brain is ""assembled"" from scratch the critical prenatal factors that shapebrain development how the birthing process itself affects the brain which forms of stimulation are most effective at promoting cognitive development how boys' and girls' brains develop differently how nutrition, stress, and other physical and social factors can permanently affect a child's brain Brilliantly blending cutting-edge science with a mother's wisdom and insight, What's Going On in There? is an invaluable contribution to the nature versus nurture debate. Children's development is determined both by the genes they are born with and the richness of their early environment. This timely and important book shows parents the innumerable ways in which they can actually help their children grow better brains.",['Lise Eliot'],Bantam,2010,['Family & Relationships'],8.0,5.0,2010-05-01,"not a ""how to"" book!","I find now that my husband and I are expecting, everyone has something to say about the way we should do things with our new family.

Providence,"“Part love story, part supernatural thriller and completely engrossing” (People)—from the acclaimed author of You, now a hit Netflix series IN DEVELOPMENT AS A PEACOCK ORIGINAL SERIES FROM THE EXECUTIVE PRODUCERS OF YOU “A dark beauty of a book, Providence kept me up at night with characters that made my heart a little bigger.”—Jessica Knoll, New York Times bestselling author of Luckiest Girl Alive Best friends in small-town New Hampshire, Jon and Chloe share an intense, near-mystical bond. But before Jon can declare his love for his soul mate, he is kidnapped, and his plans for a normal life are permanently dashed. Four years later, Jon reappears. He is different now: bigger, stronger, and with no memory of the time he was gone. Jon wants to pick up where he and Chloe left off—until the horrifying instant he realizes he possesses strange powers that pose a grave threat to everyone he cares for. Afraid of hurting Chloe, Jon runs away, embarking on a journey for answers. Meanwhile, in Providence, Rhode Island, healthy college students and townies with no connection to one another are inexplicably dropping dead. A troubled detective prone to unexplainable hunches, Charles “Eggs” DeBenedictus suspects there’s a serial killer at work.

Alas, they are very few and far between: Octavia Butler, Harry Harrison, and Gregory Benford, to name a few I have enjoyed recently. After reading the description, I had high hopes for Kress, but this book simply didn't quite make it, in my opinion. It has a good idea - genetic modification to remove the need to sleep - and a good voice in the principal character, but the world that they existed in did not spark my imagination - I could not suspend my disbelief, but instead felt like someone was making it all up.The story is that this elite group is feared as a superior species by sleep-needing humans, gets alienated and camps out in space in isolation, then makes its own plans. The sleepless are super-human - also more intelligent and immortal. This failed to convince, particularly since it was genetic engineering, which always has unforeseen consequences in the modified organisms themselves. Second, the reaction of sleepers appeared stereotypical to me, like their lack of political correctness in fear was supposed to elicit a knee-jerk reaction that referenced America's Jim Crow. Fair enough, but it was 2-dimensional. Third, the reaction of the sleepless was also over-blown, particularly with their own genetic experiments (think, ""sequel""!). Fourth, I did like the girl narrator, the only fully realized character who couldn't be labelled with an adjective right away.Recommended tepidly. THere is certainly worse scifi out there.

This book completely breaks out of the Irving mold for me (even though there were some formative years in Austria and the characters play squash, as in other books).

Survivor in Death (In Death),"Lieutenant Eve Dallas must solve the murder of a seemingly ordinary family, and protect one small, terrified survivor in this novel in the #1 New York Times bestselling In Death series. No affairs. No criminal connections. No DNA. No clues. Lieutenant Eve Dallas may be the best cop in the city—not to mention having the lavish resources of her husband Roarke at her disposal—but the Swisher case has her baffled. The family members were murdered in their beds with brutal, military precision. The state-of-the-art security was breached, and the killers used night vision to find their way through the cozy middle-class house. Clearly, Dallas is dealing with pros. The only mistake they made was to overlook the nine-year-old girl cowering in the dark in the kitchen… Now Nixie Swisher is an orphan—and the sole eyewitness to a seemingly inexplicable crime. Kids are not Dallas’s strong suit. But Nixie needs a safe place to stay, and Dallas needs to solve this case. Not only because of the promise she made to Nixie. Not only for the cause of justice. But also to put to rest some of her own darkest memories—and deepest fears.

Blinded by the Right: The Conscience of an Ex-Conservative,"In a powerful and deeply personal memoir David Brock, the original right-wing scandal reporter, chronicles his rise to the pinnacle of the conservative movement and his painful break with it. David Brock pilloried Anita Hill in a bestseller. His reporting in The American Spectator as part of the infamous “Arkansas Project” triggered the course of events that led to the historic impeachment trial of President Clinton. Brock was at the center of the right-wing dirty tricks operation of the Gingrich era—and a true believer—until he could no longer deny that the political force he was advancing was built on little more than lies, hate, and hypocrisy. In Blinded By the Right, Brock, who came out of the closet at the height of his conservative renown, tells his riveting story from the beginning, giving us the first insider’s view of what Hillary Rodham Clinton called “the vast right-wing conspiracy.” Whether dealing with the right-wing press, the richly endowed think tanks, Republican political operatives, or the Paula Jones case, Brock names names from Clarence Thomas on down, uncovers hidden links, and demonstrates how the Republican Right’s zeal for power created the poisonous political climate that culminated in George W. Bush’s election.

EXPENDABLE.,"“It was surprising what old experiences remembered could do to a presumably educated, civilized man.” And Hugh Denismore, a young doctor driving his mother’s Cadillac from Los Angeles to Phoenix, is eminently educated and civilized. He is privileged, would seem to have the world at his feet, even. Then why does the sight of a few redneck teenagers disconcert him? Why is he reluctant to pick up a disheveled girl hitchhiking along the desert highway? And why is he the first person the police suspect when she is found dead in Arizona a few days later? Dorothy B. Hughes ranks with Raymond Chandler and Patricia Highsmith as a master of mid-century noir. In books like In a Lonely Place and Ride the Pink Horse she exposed a seething discontent underneath the veneer of twentieth-century prosperity. With The Expendable Man, first published in 1963, Hughes upends the conventions of the wrong-man narrative to deliver a story that engages readers even as it implicates them in the greatest of all American crimes.",['Dorothy B.

A Hidden Wholeness: The Journey Toward an Undivided Life,"In A Hidden Wholeness, Parker Palmer reveals the same compassionate intelligence and informed heart that shaped his best-selling books Let Your Life Speak and The Courage to Teach. Here he speaks to our yearning to live undivided lives—lives that are congruent with our inner truth—in a world filled with the forces of fragmentation. Mapping an inner journey that we take in solitude and in the company of others, Palmer describes a form of community that fits the limits of our active lives. Defining a “circle of trust” as “a space between us that honors the soul,” he shows how people in settings ranging from friendship to organizational life can support each other on the journey toward living “divided no more.” This paperback edition includes two new and useful features. Circles of Trust is a DVD containing interviews with Parker J. Palmer and footage from retreats he facilitated for the Center for Courage & Renewal (www.CourageRenewal.org). Bringing the Book to Life, by Caryl Hurtig Casbon and Sally Z. Hare, is a reader's and leader's guide to exploring the themes in A Hidden Wholeness. The DVD illuminates and illustrates the principles and practices behind circles of trust. The guide includes questions that connect the DVD to the book, offering ""a conversation with the author"" as well as an engagement with the text. Together, these features give readers new ways to internalize the themes of A Hidden Wholeness and share with others this approach to sustaining identity and integrity in all the venues of our lives. Inspired by Palmer’s writing and speaking—and challenged by the conditions of twenty-first century life—people across the country, from many walks of life, have been coming together in circles of trust to reclaim their integrity and help foster wholeness in their workplaces and their world. For over a decade, the principles and practices in this book have been proven on the ground—by parents and educators, clergy and politicians, community organizers and corporate executives, physicians and attorneys, and many others who seek to rejoin soul and role in their private and public lives. A Hidden Wholeness weaves together four themes that its author has pursued for forty years: the shape of an integral life, the meaning of community, teaching and learning for transformation, and nonviolent social change. The hundreds of thousands of people who know Parker Palmer’s books will be glad to find the journey continued",['Parker J.

He's 70 years old, and considering his own mortality and legacy.I can't really tell you whether I agree or disagree with much of what he says. In fact, I don't understand a large part of it.Don't get me wrong... he's a very good speaker, and he speaks English! But he puts words together, powerful words, in ways that sound good until... you try to understand what he really means. Unfortunately, because this is a CD I listened to while driving, I couldn't make notes in the margin like I usually do. Here's an example from the CD box: ""My experience - from the depths of depression to the heights of joy - has taught me that the path toward wholeness takes patience and passion.""Of course, the path anywhere takes time (patience). But the path takes passion? Depression is a good training tool for wholeness? I kept noticing sounds without meaning... like a version of speaking in tongues. If I get through this CD set again, I'll keep track of more examples. In the meantime, just be aware that higher education is problematic (but Palmer survived the experience, as do hundreds of thousands of others), and you need a community of friends to help you find yourself.I'm still waiting for the Parker Palmer Diet and Exercise Book for Simple and Healthy, Undivided Living.",1,1

The Hobbit,"Celebrating 75 years of one of the world's most treasured classics with an all new trade paperback edition. Repackaged with new cover art. 500,000 first printing.",['J. R. R. Tolkien'],Mariner Books,2012,['Juvenile Fiction'],2580.0,5.0,2009-08-12,An 11-year-old's review,"When I first picked up this book at the bookstore, with my parents, I didn't know what to expect. I decided to get The Hobbit because of its immense popularity. Being 7 years old at the time, this was one of my first 300+ page chapter books. The introduction was simple enough: A hobbit named Bilbo Baggins was sitting lazily outside his hobbit hole, with a long pipe, when the wizard, Gandalf, came by. Our first exposure to Gandalf is quite a bit different however. ""Gandalf came by. Galdalf! If you heard only a quarter of what I heard about him, and I have only heard very little of what there is to hear, you would be prepared for any sort of remarkable tale."" To the reader, Bilbo Baggins seemed the lazy type -- content with his quiet life, baking seedcakes, smoking pipes, and living in his father's enormous hobbit hole. One must question Gandalf's motives for choosing such a person to go on a daunting quest. The ""daunting quest"" is helping 13 dwarves, including the great Thorin Oakensheid, recapture their gold from the dragon, Smaug. Smaug smashed down on the merry village of Dale, utterly destroying the village itself, eating up all its inhabitants, and (to add insult to injury) taking all of the gold and moving it into the Lonely Mountain. Thorin himself was the grandson of The King Under the Mountain, and so was even more outraged at this attack. After eating most of his food, the dwarves sang a song, which made Bilbo feel many adventurous things. Hobbits do not normally even appreciate this type of music. Bilbo must use all of the qualities he never knew he had (i.e., bravery, wisdom, ingenuity, and unselfishness). Along the way, a major part of the book takes place in Bilbo's legendary meeting with Gollum, a peculiar underground creature who calls himself ""My Precious"". Here Bilbo picks up a magic ring that gives the wearer the power of invisibility. Now, to fully understand the curiousness of a hobbit going on an adventure, you may want to know details about them. Hobbits are half the height of humans, love to eat, dress in bright colors such as green and yellow, live in holes in the ground, and hate adventures or anything that is unpredictable. The Tooks are an exception to this, and are the unpopular relations of the Bagginses. This is why Bilbo has his ""Tookish"" side. Another amazing part is Bilbo's memorable confrontation with Smaug. I would recommend this book for all ages. As this was also the intended age, since J.R.R. Tolkien wrote this book for his children (unlike the darker, yet still fabulous Lord of the Rings). And many other children will probably also enjoy this book. Lastly, I have to say that my soft cover edition of The Hobbit has lasted four years, an amazing feat for a soft cover book.",1,1
Amateur Marriage,"From the inimitable Anne Tyler, a rich and compelling novel about a mismatched marriage—and its consequences, spanning three generations. They seemed like the perfect couple—young, good-looking, made for each other. The moment Pauline, a stranger to the Polish Eastern Avenue neighborhood of Baltimore (though she lived only twenty minutes away), walked into his mother’s grocery store, Michael was smitten. And in the heat of World War II fervor, they are propelled into a hasty wedding. But they never should have married. Pauline, impulsive, impractical, tumbles hit-or-miss through life; Michael, plodding, cautious, judgmental, proceeds deliberately. While other young marrieds, equally ignorant at the start, seemed to grow more seasoned, Pauline and Michael remain amateurs. In time their foolish quarrels take their toll. Even when they find themselves, almost thirty years later, loving, instant parents to a little grandson named Pagan, whom they rescue from Haight-Ashbury, they still cannot bridge their deep-rooted differences. Flighty Pauline clings to the notion that the rifts can always be patched. To the unyielding Michael, they become unbearable. From the sound of the cash register in the old grocery to the counterculture jargon of the sixties, from the miniskirts to the multilayered apparel of later years, Anne Tyler captures the evocative nuances of everyday life during these decades with such telling precision that every page brings smiles of recognition. Throughout, as each of the competing voices bears witness, we are drawn ever more fully into the complex entanglements of family life in this wise, embracing, and deeply perceptive novel.",['Anne Tyler'],Penguin,2015,['Fiction'],43.0,5.0,2005-03-10,Great book,This was a great book with a lot of realism.

"Slaughterhouse-five: Or, The children's crusade : a duty-dance with death","A special fiftieth anniversary edition of Kurt Vonnegut’s masterpiece, “a desperate, painfully honest attempt to confront the monstrous crimes of the twentieth century” (Time), featuring a new introduction by Kevin Powers, author of the National Book Award finalist The Yellow Birds Selected by the Modern Library as one of the 100 best novels of all time Slaughterhouse-Five, an American classic, is one of the world’s great antiwar books. Centering on the infamous World War II firebombing of Dresden, the novel is the result of what Kurt Vonnegut described as a twenty-three-year struggle to write a book about what he had witnessed as an American prisoner of war. It combines historical fiction, science fiction, autobiography, and satire in an account of the life of Billy Pilgrim, a barber’s son turned draftee turned optometrist turned alien abductee. As Vonnegut had, Billy experiences the destruction of Dresden as a POW. Unlike Vonnegut, he experiences time travel, or coming “unstuck in time.” An instant bestseller, Slaughterhouse-Five made Kurt Vonnegut a cult hero in American literature, a reputation that only strengthened over time, despite his being banned and censored by some libraries and schools for content and language. But it was precisely those elements of Vonnegut’s writing—the political edginess, the genre-bending inventiveness, the frank violence, the transgressive wit—that have inspired generations of readers not just to look differently at the world around them but to find the confidence to say something about it. Authors as wide-ranging as Norman Mailer, John Irving, Michael Crichton, Tim O’Brien, Margaret Atwood, Elizabeth Strout, David Sedaris, Jennifer Egan, and J. K. Rowling have all found inspiration in Vonnegut’s words. Jonathan Safran Foer has described Vonnegut as “the kind of writer who made people—young people especially—want to write.” George Saunders has declared Vonnegut to be “the great, urgent, passionate American writer of our century, who offers us . . . a model of the kind of compassionate thinking that might yet save us from ourselves.” Fifty years after its initial publication at the height of the Vietnam War, Vonnegut's portrayal of political disillusionment, PTSD, and postwar anxiety feels as relevant, darkly humorous, and profoundly affecting as ever, an enduring beacon through our own era’s uncertainties. “Poignant and hilarious, threaded with compassion and, behind everything, the cataract of a thundering moral statement.”—The Boston Globe",['Kurt Vonnegut'],Dial Press Trade Paperback,1999,['Fiction'],1523.0,4.0,2000-05-14,S-5: The Writer's Tragedy,"Slaughterhouse-Five deals esentialy with the tragedy of an artist (in the Aristotelian context of the mimetic representation of the physis -nature-, this time the human one) triyng to deal with a tragedy too much too near to be handled as raw matter for art safely and efectively, in proportion to the artist's pourposes. It's about the trial of living the darkest moments of a life and the trial of communicating them inside the artist's aesthetical rigeur, both concentrical and within the other, as a Russian doll. Vonnegut it's every word aware of the risk of his &quot;duty with death&quot;. He wants to be the witness he was in the macabre Bombing of Dresden (as an American prisoner of German ascendance and all the tearing contradictions that circumstance implies), but he wants to tell the World about it as an artist, troughout the capacities of amplification and enhancement of ideas and concepts the creative act allows. Therefore, the Biochemist turned into a soldier, a prisioner, a journalist, a writer, disguises himself as a childlike young Champlain's help turned into a soldier, a prisioner, an opthometrist, and a voice of humanity among extraterrestrial beings, in order to talk in an apparently linear and childlike inocent way about a story he knows too much about, letting all the sad personas of the biographical being comunicate succesfully, due to the choice of images, the tragical esence of the pathos he had to live through. Not so long ago I was reading Italian writer Alessandro Baricco and saw a Vonnegutian way of telling a story in his writing.",0,1
Couples,"“Trapped in their cozy catacombs, the couples have made sex by turns their toy, their glue, their trauma, their therapy, their hope, their frustration, their revenge, their narcotic, their main line of communication and their sole and pitiable shield against the awareness of death.”—Time One of the signature novels of the American 1960s, Couples is a book that, when it debuted, scandalized the public with prose pictures of the way people live, and that today provides an engrossing epitaph to the short, happy life of the “post-Pill paradise.” It chronicles the interactions of ten young married couples in a seaside New England community who make a cult of sex and of themselves. The group of acquaintances form a magical circle, complete with ritualistic games, religious substitutions, a priest (Freddy Thorne), and a scapegoat (Piet Hanema). As with most American utopias, this one’s existence is brief and unsustainable, but the “imaginative quest” that inspires its creation is eternal. Praise for Couples “Couples [is] John Updike’s tour de force of extramarital wanderlust.”—The New York Times Book Review “Ingenious . . . If this is a dirty book, I don’t see how sex can be written about at all.”—Wilfrid Sheed, The New York Times Book Review",['John Updike'],Random House,2012,['Fiction'],1.0,1.0,2002-05-10,I didn't like it.,"This book is the reason I've read only one John Updike novel.

Superpower: The Making of a Steam Locomotive,"Depicts the building of the ""Berkshire"" steam locomotive.",[],David R. Godine Publisher,1987,['Juvenile Nonfiction'],1.0,5.0,2002-04-07,A Fascinating Look at a Magnificent Machine,"David Weitzman has a love of technology and history. This can be demonstrated by observing the names of books he authored, including titles ranging from ""Traces of the Past: A Field Guide to Industrial Archaeology"" to ""Underfoot: An Everyday Guide to Exploring the American Past."" This fortuitous blend of history and technology is the underlying theme of this book.For those of you who may be expecting a typical 'picture book' about a steam locomotive, this book will definitely come as a surprise. Although well illustrated, there are no photographs. This omission is more than compensated for by the line drawings that are precise and informative. The text is educational and interesting; the text and the line drawings compement each other very nicely. The combination is such that the reader is virtually transported by osmosis back to the year 1925 and to the dark and dingy backshops of the Lima Locomotive Works of Lima, Ohio, in order to not only personally witness but to actually physically participate in the birth of this magnificent machine, the first 'Super Power' steam locomotive ever.Another pleasant surprise in this work is the interaction of man and machine, the creator and the fruit of his labor. Too many books about the locomotive ignore the human role; here the combination of man and machine is a symbiotic relationship.This book is both easy to read and educational, and it is designed to appeal to anyone in age from beginning high-schooler to adult. Anyone possessing an interest in the mechanical world should obtain a copy of this book.",14,14

The Facts of Life: and Other Dirty Jokes,"If you had to give America a voice, it’s been said more than once, that voice would be Willie Nelson’s. For more than fifty years, he’s taken the stuff of his life-the good and the bad-and made from it a body of work that has become a permanent part of our musical heritage and kept us company through the good and the bad of our own lives. Long before he became famous as a performer, Willie Nelson was known as a songwriter, keeping his young family afloat by writing songs-like “Crazy”-that other people turned into hits. So it’s fitting, and cause for celebration, that he has finally set down in his own words, a book that does justice to his great gifts as a storyteller. In The Facts of Life, Willie Nelson reflects on what has mattered to him in life and what hasn’t. He also tells some great dirty jokes. The result is a book as wise and hilarious as its author. It’s not meant to be taken seriously as an instruction manual for living-but you could do a lot worse.",['Willie Nelson'],Random House,2009,['Biography & Autobiography'],1.0,5.0,2003-06-05,Classic Willie Nelson,"He has such a great sense of humor.

He drives home his brand-new Corvette one day to discover a strange doll on his doorstep. It's a rag doll made entirely of white cloth, with no face or hair or clothes. Where the eyes should be, there are two crossed stitches of black thread. Five sets of crossed black stitches mark the mouth, and another pair form an X over the heart. He brings it into the house. That night, he hears an odd little popping sound and looks up to see the crossed stitches over the doll's heart breaking apart. When he picks up the doll, he feels something pulsing in its chest. Another thread unravels to reveal a reptilian green eye --and not a doll's eye, because it blinks.

My War: Killing Time in Iraq,"'Once we passed the checkpoint at the border, it hit me. I was like, Holy Shit, this is it, I'm entering a combat zone. Cool!' At twenty-six Colby Buzzell, unemployed and living at home, decided to join the US Army. Within months he was in Iraq, a machine gunner in the controversial Stryker Brigade Combat Team, an army unit on the cutting edge of combat technology and the first of its kind. Trapped amid 'guerrilla warfare, urban-style' in Mosul, Iraq, Buzzell was struck by the bizarre and often frightening world surrounding him. He began writing a blog describing the war - not as being reported by CNN or official briefings - but as experienced by the soldier on the ground. His story is a brutally honest and hard-hitting account of the absurdities of modern war. These are the real stories of the war: a firefight where the resistance came from 'men in black'; a night spent chain-smoking in the guard tower counting the tracer bullets being fired over the city; and the hesitation of a young soldier who had been passed around from platoon to platoon because he was too afraid to fight.

From Potter's Field,"The sixth book in the Kay Scarpetta series, from No. 1 bestselling author Patricia Cornwell. 'America's most chilling writer of crime fiction' The Times Christmas had never been a particularly good time for Dr Kay Scarpetta. Although a holiday for most, it always seem to heighten the alienation felt by society's violent fringe; and that usually means more work for Scarpetta, Virginia's Chief Medical Examiner. The body was naked, female and found propped against a fountain in a bleak area of New York's Central Park. Her apparent manner of death points to a modus operandi that is chillingly familiar: the gunshot wound to the head, the sections of skin excised from the body, the displayed corpse - all suggest that Temple Brooks Gault, Scarpetta's nemesis, is back at work. Calling on all her reserves of courage and skill, and the able assistance of colleagues Marino and Wesley, Scarpetta must track this most dangerous of killers in pursuit of survival as well as justice - heading inexorably to an electrifying climax amid the dark, menacing labyrinths of the New York subway.

Also, please don't TELL us that Gault is the worst murderer of the century, SHOW us. Prove it! My personal quibble is that when our heroine is talking with a woman's father and he asks if his daughter is dead, Kay answers with a flat yes, when at most she's got a hunch as to the identity of the dead woman. This is inconceivable for a forensic pathologist whose specialty is not only what she knows, but what she can prove.

When the Constitutional Convention was completed on September 17, 1787 in Philadelphia, the newly-agreed upon Constitution was sent to the states for ratification. As opponents of a strong centralized government began attacking the Constitution in the press, Hamilton recruited Jay and Madison to contribute articles and essays in favor of Federalism to prominent journals and newspapers. Published between October 27, 1787 and May 28, 1788, The Federalist Papers were written by the three authors under the pseudonym “Publius.” Although Hamilton wrote the vast majority, Madison’s and Jay’s contributions are still seen as essential works on the philosophy of American governance. Federalist Nos. 10 and 14, both written by Madison, are regarded as especially significant for arguing for the possibility of effectively governing an expansive republic. In Federalist No. 84, Hamilton argues against adding a Bill of Rights, a proposed compromise with Anti-Federalists that would eventually make up the first ten Amendments to the Constitution. Other important topics introduced or explained in The Federalist Papers include the doctrine of judicial review, the case for a single chief executive, and the purpose of checks and balances. With a beautifully designed cover and professionally typeset manuscript, this edition of The Federalist Papers is a classic of American political history reimagined for modern readers.","['Alexander Hamilton', 'John Jay', 'James Madison']",Graphic Arts Books,2021,['Political Science'],1.0,5.0,2000-03-09,Most definitely worth reading,"Every American citizen -- and those who want to be one -- should read this and related documents.

The story is completely nonsensical and at times humorous. In fact I think some of the jokes can only be understood as an adult so it is worth reading again.I have a yellowed copy of Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass, which was given to me on my seventh birthday. It has the original artwork on the cover. My grandmother gave me a copy along with a harmonica. The harmonica was lost long ago, the book remains and has always had a place in my heart. I was too young to read the entire book, so my father started reading this book to me. Perhaps still having this book has given me a connection to the past.I laugh when I reminisce about my father singing ""Beautiful Soup,"" most beautifully I must add. He also recited ""Jabberwocky"" and I can still hear his voice as I read the tale of the Walrus:""The time has come,' the Walrus said,""To talk of many things:Of shoes - and ships - and sealing wax -of cabbages - and kings -and why the sea is boiling hotand whether pigs have wings.""Alice spends a great deal of time either shrinking or growing taller, depending on what she eats in Wonderland. There are talking chess pieces and flowers. Everything in the looking glass world is backwards so it is fun to think about how life would be on the other side of a mirror.The Mad Tea Party is also very memorable. There is all kinds of nonsense conversation children will love to try to figure out, and as adults still might be trying to figure out! They will love the riddles and beautiful illustrations. The mouse, the chess pieces and the Cheshire cat talk most intelligently about various concerns in Wonderland. Just as everything in a child's world is sometimes alive to them, so Alice's world is filled with things that are alive and most interesting to children.Alice never seems to run out of adventures. The Looking Glass House is amusing to me as it has a cute black kitten who is quite mischievous. I quote:""Oh, you wicked, wicked little thing!"" cried Alice catching up the kitten and giving it a little kiss to make it understand that it was in disgrace. ""Really, Dinah ought to have taught you better manners! ...Kitty sat very demurely on her knee, pretending to watch the progress of the winding, and now and then putting out one paw and gently touching the ball, as if it would be glad to help if it might.John Tenniel's illustrations make the book and together he and Lewis Carroll created a magical world for children to explore.~The Rebecca Review",1,1

The Hundred Days,"""One of the best novelists since Jane Austen....The Hundred Days may be the best installment yet....I give O'Brian's fans joy of it.""—Philadelphia Inquirer Napoleon, escaped from Elba, pursues his enemies across Europe like a vengeful phoenix. If he can corner the British and Prussians before their Russian and Austrian allies arrive, his genius will lead the French armies to triumph at Waterloo. In the Balkans, preparing a thrust northwards into Central Europe to block the Russians and Austrians, a horde of Muslim mercenaries is gathering. They are inclined toward Napoleon because of his conversion to Islam during the Egyptian campaign, but they will not move without a shipment of gold ingots from Sheik Ibn Hazm which, according to British intelligence, is on its way via camel caravan to the coast of North Africa. It is this gold that Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin must at all costs intercept. The fate of Europe hinges on their desperate mission. ""The Hundred Days is certain to delight O'Brian's fans, for whom happiness is an unending stream of Aubrey/Maturin books....[It] is a fine novel that stands proudly on the shelf with the others.""—Los Angeles Times","[""Patrick O'Brian""]",W. W. Norton & Company,2011,['Fiction'],12.0,5.0,1998-10-29,"One of the best of the series, but challenging","Scanning through the other customer reviews of &quot;The Hundred Days&quot;, I am struck by the chasm between those who condemn the book (sometimes in startlingly harsh terms) and those who applaud it. I count myself firmly among the latter, but acknowledge that this volume differs significantly from earlier entries in the series. What some readers apparently view as an absence of skill and spirit on O'Brian's part, I find instead to be the product of a subtle and masterful command of the literary art. Death is a central theme, Death is a chief character of &quot;The Hundred Days&quot;, and I find it not surprising at all that O'Brian has elected to use a style in keeping with that particular focus. I have seen numerous comments from dissatisfied readers decrying O'Brian's &quot;failure&quot; to deal with the deaths of major characters at length. With all due respect, I think that view misses the whole point of what and how O'Brian has written. The cheapest, most false piece of writing produced by any hack would have lavished sorrow upon these deaths; shedding shallow tears would have been the easy thing to do. The abruptness of these deaths, even the absence of healing mourning, heightens the pain and the sense of loss we feel. O'Brian has not written a book to make us &quot;feel good&quot;. Instead he has painted for us a portrait of emotional constraint, the hues of the world washed over with the grey of an unexpressed grief. Only at rare moments are we pernitted to see the black gulf beneath Stephen's determined insistence to continue on after Diana's death. He is a man who is hiding even -- or, especially -- from himself the depth of his loss, while we see that grief has dulled his usual acuity. O'Brian has not tried to &quot;entertain&quot; us here, and those seeking light diversion would do better to look elsewhere. No, &quot;The Hundred Days&quot; is not an easy book, but it evidences an undiminished literary skill. I believe this novel to be O'Brian's finest writing in several years. Long after finishing it, &quot;The Hundred Days&quot; haunts me.",26,27

Over time, he comes to regret murdering her partly because of his paranoid thoughts that people are on to him and partly because he learns that each person, no matter how seemingly low, has value and the inherent right to live. Somehow, Dostoevsky insinuates Raskolnikov's paranoia, dread and remorse into the reader's own psyche.

The Song of the Scaffold,"This is a classic novelette set in the time of the French Revolution, an epoch that vividly demonstrated man's capacity for both heroism and brutality. It is an intense and compelling drama based on the true story of the Carmelite nuns at Compeigne beheaded during the last few days of the Revolution, but also encompassing the Paris mob, the Reign of Terror, women revolutionists, etc., climaxing in the heroic martyrdom of sixteen Carmelites. This story unfolds around Blanche de la Force, who enters the Carmelite convent amid the horror of the French Revolution. Blanche is so timorous that she seems unsuited to the rigors of religious life even at the best of times - and badly misplaced as the Reign of Terror begins to stain France with the blood of martyrs. Sister Marie, one of the leading nuns in the convent, receives with joy the death threats of the revolutionaries: the sisters are going to be awarded the crown of Christian martyrdom! Sister Marie prepares the other nuns for this fearsome sacrifice, all the while harboring doubts about Blanches ability and willingness to join them in dying for Christ. Blanches life thereafter and the story of the nuns take several unexpected twists, leaving you not only with the inspiring, true witness of their martyrdom, but also with a penetrating insight into the nature of holiness.

Human nature is inevitable and nothing we build will ever change our ways of living. Some one will always get greedy, someone will always want a little more.My honest opinion about whether or not this book should be required to read (this may sound childish) is no. When I think of summer vacation, I don't think of work. My sugarcoated opinion however slightly differs. I still do not think that it should be required to read because reading a book about mankind's tedious path to doom, to me, foreshadows upcoming events in my English class.

Anyone who advocates for children wins me over, before and after all else. Of course there is much more to Sister Souljah's autobiography than the children she crusades for; she had to go through some things before reaching a platform from which she could stage her fight to help empower disenfranchised children.Other spots that engaged me as well; her relationship with her family, and as well other relationships... Nathan (of course being the premier), but also Joseph...(Sonya's spiel was truly potent), and Chance I just adored...at first! And that incident in Baltimore had me in stitches. Oh, that was one of a special kind of hilarious. Nikki was interesting, and also that talk on lesbianism with Mona. Tusani, and her mother Nita, just may have been the most stirring. It was the message behind the mother's message that I found tremendous; one where although it wasn't written, I felt wasn't lost on Sister Souljah either--the other thing I found impressive...her openness to hear what the people she was trying to help, and as well all of those she forged relationships with, were saying.I highly recommend `No Disrespect.'

The Yokota Officers Club,"Sarah Bird’s gutsy, sharp, and touching new novel opens at full speed. Bernadette ""Bernie"" Root, military brat, speaks. She has never really noticed what a peculiar bunch of nomads her eight-member Air Force family is (with the exception of her Post Princess sister, Kit), until the summer after her first year of college when she joins them at their new assignment: Kadena Air Base, Okinawa. Just as Okinawa turns out to be a sorry version of the Japanese paradise Bernie knew in her childhood at Yokota Air Base, her family, especially her once-beautiful mother, Moe, and her former spy-pilot father, Mace, seems to have been in decline since those glory days of the American Raj. Days when her mother was happy and their best friend, Fumiko, now lost to them, was the family’s maid. The worst part of Okinawa for Bernie, though, is realizing how perfectly she fits with her oddball family and how badly she needs to get out. So when a dance contest first prize, a trip to Japan,offers a chance to escape, she takes it, playing second banana to a third-rate comedian on a tour of Japan’s military bases. At their grand finale at the Yokota Officers’ Club, Fumiko finally reappears, and Bernie discovers the terrible price that is paid when the secrets nations hide end up buried within families. A brilliantly appealing novel whose energy, wit, and feeling have won for it (see back of the jacket) extraordinary advance praise.",['Sarah Bird'],Ballantine Books,2010,['Fiction'],3.0,5.0,2003-01-06,"A Very Real, Beautifully Written Memoir/Novel","I will not discuss the plot of The Yokota Officers Club--other reviewers have described as much of it as should be revealed.But I will say that as a Navy brat whose entire personality was created and has been defined by that experience, Ms. Bird knows the animal well. She verges on caricature at times, but not by much, and frankly needs to do that in my view to convey to those outside the military world what it is really like to live within it. If you were there, especially in the time in which her novel is set, this novel will gut-punch you. Like many, I could not put it down; I did not want it to end; there was a horror and yet a fascination in it, a longing for a clear and simple and logical past swept away in the societal changes we have all faced; a shame in part at much that was bad in it.Read this book, and learn a lot about a people and a culture deeply important to our country. And if you are a brat, take this to your shrink and tell them this is the best introduction to why you are seeing him/her that you could ever need.I am profoundly grateful for, and a bit aghast at, this book.",3,3
Cold Zero: Inside the FBI Hostage Rescue Team,"Only 200 people have ever been in Christopher Whitcomb's elite branch of the F.B.I.

With breathtaking immediacy, Whitcomb describes the brutal training, the weapons and tactics, and the unbreakable camaraderie of the HRT. In short order, after joining HRT in 1991, Whitcomb was sent on missions to Ruby Ridge and Waco, and his frank assessment of those missions is must reading for anyone interested in modern law enforcement.

Alice's Adventures in Wonderland,"Alice in Wonderland (also known as Alice's Adventures in Wonderland), from 1865, is the peculiar and imaginative tale of a girl who falls down a rabbit-hole into a bizarre world of eccentric and unusual creatures. Lewis Carroll's prominent example of the genre of ""literary nonsense"" has endured in popularity with its clever way of playing with logic and a narrative structure that has influence generations of fiction writing.",['Lewis Carroll'],The Floating Press,2009,['Fiction'],179.0,3.0,2012-01-31,"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland: Intersting, Yet Confusing","In the book Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll, a little girl named Alice wanders off from her sister on the bank to chase after a talking rabbit. Once the rabbit went down a well-like hole, she soon followed, falling down and down for what seemed like forever. At her landing, she appeared in a whole new world, with talking caterpillars, floating/disappearing cats, and food that makes you grow and shrink. Another major aspect of the rising action is when Alice ate a special cake that made her grow extremely large in the rabbit's house. It made her realize how weird this Wonderland was.I enjoyed the beginning of this book because it was very interesting how random organisms were talking, for example, a smoking caterpillar. Another interesting factor was the bottle that read ""Drink Me"" and the cake that read ""Eat Me""; the liquid made her shrink while the cake made her grow. Once it got towards the middle of the novel, I got progressively confused. I think this book is a little too random: especially when it goes from the Mad-Hatters tea party to the Queen's croquet match. The transitions from each scene made it confusing to read because it went too fast. Another reason this book is confusing is because it was written in 1865 and some of the language is outdated. The style of Lewis Carroll's writing is creative, but extremely odd. I didn't understand some parts of the book, like when Carroll puts parenthesis throughout the dialect; overall, it was too obscure.",1,2

The Qur'an gave them Allah's answer.He [i.e. Zul-qarnain] followed, until he reached the setting of the sun. He found it set in a spring of murky water.(Surah XVIII ( Kahf) vs. 85-86)We agree with Muslim scholars that Zul-qarnain refers to Alexander the Great (see Yusuf Ali's appendix on this subject in his translation of the Qur'an). According to this surah, Alexander the Great traveled west until he found out what happened to the sun. It went down into and under the murky waters of a pond. When it was completely covered by the water, darkness fell upon the earth.To the early Muslims, this surah gave the divine answer as to why darkness fell when the sun set in the West. They assumed that the sun, like the moon, was the size perceived by the human eye, about the size of a basketball. Darkness came when with a mighty hissing roar it went down under the dark waters of a pond. They boldly and proudly proclaimed that this marvelous answer proved that the Qur'an was indeed the Word of God.Today, modern Muslims are quite embarrassed by this passage and try to ignore it or to quickly dismiss it as poetry. But the passage is not part of a poem. Thus it cannot be dismissed as figurative language or poetic license. In the context, it is part of a historical narrative which relates several historical incidences in the life of Alexander the Great.The mistake was based on the erroneous assumption that the earth was flat. The authors of the Qur'an did not know that the earth was a sphere which revolved around the sun.",19,40

The Cloister Walk,"A NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER AND NEW YORK TIMES NOTABLE BOOK OF THE YEAR “Vivid, compelling... An embrace of moral and spiritual contemplation.” –The New York Times “A remarkable piece of writing. If read with humility and attention, Kathleen Norris's book becomes lectio divina, or holy reading.” –The Boston Globe From the iconic author of Amazing Grace: A Vocabulary of Faith, a spiritual journey that brings joy to the meanings of love, grace and faith. Why would a married woman with a thoroughly Protestant background and often more doubt than faith be drawn to the ancient practice of monasticism, to a community of celibate men whose days are centered on a rigid schedule of prayer, work, and scripture? This is the question that poet Kathleen Norris asks us as, somewhat to her own surprise, she found herself on two extended residencies at St. John's Abbey in Minnesota. Part record of her time among the Benedictines, part meditation on various aspects of monastic life, The Cloister Walk demonstrates, from the rare perspective of someone who is both an insider and outsider, how immersion in the cloistered world-- its liturgy, its ritual, its sense of community-- can impart meaning to everyday events and deepen our secular lives. In this stirring and lyrical work, the monastery, often considered archaic or otherworldly, becomes immediate, accessible, and relevant to us, no matter what our faith may be.",['Kathleen Norris'],Penguin,1997,['Religion'],16.0,2.0,2008-10-01,"self-absorbed, rambling, scattered, disjointed....","For the life of me, I don't see what people get out of Kathleen Norris' writing!

Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed),"A literary sensation and runaway bestseller, this brilliant debut novel tells with seamless authenticity and exquisite lyricism the true confessions of one of Japan's most celebrated geisha. Nominated as one of America’s best-loved novels by PBS’s The Great American Read Speaking to us with the wisdom of age and in a voice at once haunting and startlingly immediate, Nitta Sayuri tells the story of her life as a geisha. It begins in a poor fishing village in 1929, when, as a nine-year-old girl with unusual blue-gray eyes, she is taken from her home and sold into slavery to a renowned geisha house. We witness her transformation as she learns the rigorous arts of the geisha: dance and music; wearing kimono, elaborate makeup, and hair; pouring sake to reveal just a touch of inner wrist; competing with a jealous rival for men's solicitude and the money that goes with it. In Memoirs of a Geisha, we enter a world where appearances are paramount; where a girl's virginity is auctioned to the highest bidder; where women are trained to beguile the most powerful men; and where love is scorned as illusion. It is a unique and triumphant work of fiction—at once romantic, erotic, suspenseful—and completely unforgettable.",['Arthur Golden'],Vintage,1999,['Fiction'],1631.0,4.0,2006-04-24,Charles Dickens meets Jane Austen by way of old Kyoto,"Arthur Golden's MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA is that rarest of rare things: a genuinely intelligent and beautifully written novel that also managed to become for years a bestseller.

His heroine, Sayuri (Chiyo), is also neither like Dickens's David Copperfield or Austen's Fanny Price is that she is much more proactive and is at times even devious, but she shares their deprived upbringings and victimizations by childhood nemeses--and, like them, becomes recognized for her true worth as she matures. Golden also writes like a dream, and has done superb historical research for his work.

Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder,"Offers a documented and reasoned solution to one of the strangest of all unsolved murders in the annals of modern crime, the murder of aspiring starlet Elizabeth Short in Los Angeles in 1947.",['John Gilmore'],Amok Books,2006,['History'],4.0,5.0,2000-05-16,A REMARKABLE BOOK,"Without doubt, this is one of the best books published the last ten years. A real-life thriller full of twists and turns. It is shocking and disturbing. A war time, homefront world from coast to coast; a vivacious, glamourous girl (Elizabeth Short, the Black Dahlia), weaves an incredible trail we are compelled to follow. The characters remind one of Damon Runyon and Jim Thompson, though John Gilmore is a commanding writer with a unique, original talent and a flair for the macabre. The killer is like someone in an old B-movie noir thriller or a spooky Sherlock Holmes mystery, but convinces and scared the pants of this reader. To think this psycho walked the streets is frightening. A highly recommended true crime read. By far the best of all thats been presented on this famous nonfiction murder.",9,11

Slaughter-House Five (First paperback edition),"A special fiftieth anniversary edition of Kurt Vonnegut’s masterpiece, “a desperate, painfully honest attempt to confront the monstrous crimes of the twentieth century” (Time), featuring a new introduction by Kevin Powers, author of the National Book Award finalist The Yellow Birds Selected by the Modern Library as one of the 100 best novels of all time Slaughterhouse-Five, an American classic, is one of the world’s great antiwar books. Centering on the infamous World War II firebombing of Dresden, the novel is the result of what Kurt Vonnegut described as a twenty-three-year struggle to write a book about what he had witnessed as an American prisoner of war. It combines historical fiction, science fiction, autobiography, and satire in an account of the life of Billy Pilgrim, a barber’s son turned draftee turned optometrist turned alien abductee. As Vonnegut had, Billy experiences the destruction of Dresden as a POW. Unlike Vonnegut, he experiences time travel, or coming “unstuck in time.” An instant bestseller, Slaughterhouse-Five made Kurt Vonnegut a cult hero in American literature, a reputation that only strengthened over time, despite his being banned and censored by some libraries and schools for content and language. But it was precisely those elements of Vonnegut’s writing—the political edginess, the genre-bending inventiveness, the frank violence, the transgressive wit—that have inspired generations of readers not just to look differently at the world around them but to find the confidence to say something about it. Authors as wide-ranging as Norman Mailer, John Irving, Michael Crichton, Tim O’Brien, Margaret Atwood, Elizabeth Strout, David Sedaris, Jennifer Egan, and J. K. Rowling have all found inspiration in Vonnegut’s words. Jonathan Safran Foer has described Vonnegut as “the kind of writer who made people—young people especially—want to write.” George Saunders has declared Vonnegut to be “the great, urgent, passionate American writer of our century, who offers us . . . a model of the kind of compassionate thinking that might yet save us from ourselves.” Fifty years after its initial publication at the height of the Vietnam War, Vonnegut's portrayal of political disillusionment, PTSD, and postwar anxiety feels as relevant, darkly humorous, and profoundly affecting as ever, an enduring beacon through our own era’s uncertainties. “Poignant and hilarious, threaded with compassion and, behind everything, the cataract of a thundering moral statement.”—The Boston Globe",['Kurt Vonnegut'],Dial Press Trade Paperback,1999,['Fiction'],1523.0,4.0,2002-01-07,An Atypical Novel,"Few novels contain the sense of humor and the sense of tragedy as this Vonnegut classic. This novel is about aliens, but is not science-fiction. This novel is about war, but makes you laugh. Almost impossible to describe, Slaughter-house Five captures the absudity and hopelessness of life in the most humorous way imaginable. The subject matter seems similar to Heller's &quot;Catch 22&quot;, but the philosophical approach to time as the protagonist becomes &quot;unstuck in time&quot; makes this novel novel more compelling.",0,0
Finnegans Wake,"A daring work of experimental, Modernist genius, James Joyce's Finnegans Wake is one of the greatest literary achievements of the twentieth century, and the crowning glory of Joyce's life. The Penguin Modern Classics edition of includes an introduction by Seamus Deane 'riverrun, past Eve and Adam's, from swerve of shore to bend of bay, brings us by a commodius vicus of recirculation back to Howth Castle and Environs' Joyce's final work, Finnegan's Wake is his masterpiece of the night as Ulysses is of the day. Supreme linguistic virtuosity conjures up the dark underground worlds of sexuality and dream. Joyce undermines traditional storytelling and all official forms of English and confronts the different kinds of betrayal - cultural, political and sexual - that he saw at the heart of Irish history. Dazzlingly inventive, with passages of great lyrical beauty and humour, Finnegans Wake remains one of the most remarkable works of the twentieth century. James Joyce (1882-1941), the eldest of ten children, was born in Dublin, but exiled himself to Paris at twenty as a rebellion against his upbringing. He only returned to Ireland briefly from the continent but Dublin was at heart of his greatest works, Ulysses and Finnegans Wake. He lived in poverty until the last ten years of his life and was plagued by near blindness and the grief of his daughter's mental illness. If you enjoyed Finnegans Wake, you might like Virginia Woolf's The Waves, also available in Penguin Classics. 'An extraordinary performance, a transcription into a miniaturized form of the whole western literary tradition' Seamus Deane",['James Joyce'],Penguin UK,2015,['Fiction'],24.0,4.0,2010-12-27,"Whether relevant or not, an incredible accomplishment","As I'm sure many have discovered, it's imperative (if a near prerequisite) that anyone wishing to appreciate ""Finnegans Wake"" acquire of copy of Joseph Campbell's Skeleton Key. One could theoretically go it alone, or certainly use the many other companion pieces and interpretations that have appeared over the decades, but not only is Campbell's by and large the ""original"" Rosetta Stone for this tome, it's also, at least to me, the most intellectually and spiritually fulfilling.Of course, as the saying goes, ask someone to interpret a passage of the Wake and that will tell you a lot about that person. So I don't pretend that Campbell's analysis or my own is correct. Rather, I feel it's a good rebuttal to the cynically prevalent question of ""Is it worth my time?"", for which the asker usually has their own answer of ""No!"" at the immediate ready.The Wake is Joyce's attempt to put the Universe in print, to squeeze Life, with all its yins and yangs, between two covers. It is an exhaustive and noble effort; ""ambitious"" proves too thin a word for the scope of, well, his ambitions. Quite honestly, many elements mesh when viewed through a pantheistic prism. Finnegan's fall from the ladder at the beginning is essentially the fall of Adam, or, rather, to put it more positively, the transformation of the ""God"" figure from a high state of paradise to the ruggedness of the physical world (the idea being that, always perfect, God/Cosmos couldn't know perfection until it had experienced the other polarity - one can't know hot without cold, etc.). Soon after, Finnegan is replaced by the character HCE (one meaning of which is ""Here Comes Everyone""), who creates multiple families (just as humans have created multiple societies), and is swept up in violence and scandal.This barely scrapes the surface of the Wake's vastness. It is also drawn from over sixty languages, cycles back on itself much as seasons (and the Universe, as projected by the Big Crunch theory), and some have even spotted patterns of DNA structure in its pages.Just as the world is a three-dimensional Rorscharch test, seen differently by every set of eyes, understood differently by every mind, so too is the Wake a glorious experience in subjectivity. Life in print. And for this if nothing else, Joyce as an imaginative artist deserves significant accolades.",1,1
The Pledge,"Set in a small town in Switzerland, The Pledge centers around the murder of a young girl and the detective who promises the victim’s mother he will find the perpetrator. After deciding the wrong man has been arrested for the crime, the detective lays a trap for the real killer—with all the patience of a master fisherman. But cruel turns of plot conspire to make him pay dearly for his pledge. Here Friedrich Dürrenmatt conveys his brilliant ear for dialogue and a devastating sense of timing and suspense. Joel Agee’s skilled translation effectively captures the various voices in the original, as well as its chilling conclusion. One of Dürrenmatt’s most diabolically imagined and constructed novels, The Pledge was adapted for the screen in 2000 in a film directed by Sean Penn and starring Jack Nicholson.",['Friedrich Dürrenmatt'],University of Chicago Press,2017,['Fiction'],3.0,4.0,2000-02-11,The Pledge,"If your looking for an entertaining read,pick up this book.

"The Successful Child: What Parents Can Do to Help Kids Turn Out Well (Sears, William, Sears Parenting Library.)","In this book, the Searses bring the reason and common sense of their philosophy of parenting to the hurdles of raising the older child. Attachment parenting is not just for babies; as children grow, they need to expand the web of their secure attachments to friends, teachers, community and the wider world. As there is no single plan for any one family, the Searses show a range of ways a parent can retain a child's trust and wield a positive influence as their child matures. By following the advice laid out in this book, parents can see that the bonds they have nurtured since infancy will provide the anchor that will ground their children through the challenging teen years to adulthood.","['William Sears', 'Martha Sears', 'Elizabeth Pantley']","Little, Brown",2002,['Family & Relationships'],3.0,2.0,2002-12-01,Don't be a Dr. Sears Clone!!,"The first Dr. Sears book I read was &quot;The Baby Book&quot;, which I found helpful and somewhat insightful as many other parents that are gentle in raising their children. But I became very turned off by this book and the entire Dr. Sears following that has thousands of parents looking to him as the guru of child care. This book, like all the others in the &quot;Sears library&quot; of books is a carbon copy of his other books and reiterates the same beliefs. He uses this book as a medium to promote his attachment parenting beliefs and uses the title &quot;the successful child&quot; to make parents believe that his parenting beliefs are the rule rather than the exception. Yes, I know that Dr. Sears has eight kids and is a well renowned pediatrician, but that doesn't make him the authority on parenting and child development and other issues that he has written books on including family nutrition, pregnancy, and childbirth, and to suggest so would make his books utterly self-congratulatory other than proven techniques that work across the board. I hope the parents of his patients don't feel that they have to conform to his beliefs in terms of how they choose to raise their children. It is good to take what is useful to you as a parent from various sources such as this book; but I refuse to see Dr. Sears as an authority on my child's development and on my role as a parent just because he has written dozens of books that are regurgitations of each other.

Largely an account of the experiences of the author, the then-renowned Russian mathematician Ouspensky, during his time with the still-renowned Spiritual Master Gurdjieff, it details the basics of Gurdjieff's teachings, as well as detailed descriptions of Ouspensky's personal interest, i.e. some of the esoteric schemata, diagrams and symbols Gurdjieff included in his teachings. In Search was one of the first explicitly spiritual books I ever read, and it left me astonished because it outlined in stark, clear terms so many things I had long vaguely suspected but never been able to articulate. Man is asleep, a slave to his conditioning, pushed about by early imprints and external influences, without much of a consistent will, understanding or direction. If this resonates in any way with you, even vaguely, then read this book - it might just be your doorway.In speaking to many readers of the book over the years, it appears most of them are not especially touched by the intricate details on the ray of creation, the food diagram, the enneagram and the four bodies, although these can be used as easy fodder for wonderful discourse. But when it comes to transformation, it seems that the basic principles including the notion of man's sleep, daydreaming, hypnotized state, negative emotions, wasting of energy, the importance of finding a school, and the development of the essence underneath the personality, can profoundly alter the way a person looks at themselves, others, the world, and reality.Interestingly, the Gurdjieff work is still alive, largely organized through the efforts of the Gurdjieff Foundation, with active groups in many cities world-wide that meet weekly to practice together. While the Work has evolved somewhat from the principles outlined in In Search (which covers the early years of the Work in the early 1900s), the basic principles as outlined in In Search form its foundation. Gurdjieff, upon reading In Search, is quoted to have confirmed that it was a truthful account of his teaching in those early years.A more recent account of inner work from Gurdjieff's foremost student, Jeanne de Salzmann, is her ""The Reality of Being"", published in 2010. Both books give taste of the Gurdjieff Work, then and now, with In Search being more accessible for those new to the Spiritual Path and/or the Gurdjieff Work. Personally, I thank Mr. Gurdjieff for all his labor for our sake, and Mr. Ouspensky for writing this book that continues to offer a taste of it for so many.",4,4

The good part of this story is the writer's ability to create emotional connections between characters in a very few scenes - a buddy/sidekick one between Hugh and Klyd who are the main heros of the book, between Klyd and Denrau, his donor, Klyd and his family members, Yenava his wife and his grandfather, and so on. The relationship is closest between channel (the quasi vampire like character) and donor, closer perhaps than between man and wife, because one requires the other to live. The characters Lichtenberg creates in this book are exquisitely drawn and likable. The theme of opposites (predator and prey) working together to save an apocalyptic world are rich with promise. A reader can develop a real emotional connection to the characters and the premise, particularly as Klyd the quasi Vampire character begins to fixate on Hugh as a potential if reluctant donor, as the border policeman goes off to rescue his girlfriend, with Klyd's help, from a band of renegades. And the book has humor at times. In all respects it is well worth a read.The downsides are this is a first novel, so expect occasional clumsiness in mechanics and phrasing in the first few pages. Don't let that turn you off as it is minor and disappears as the author reaches her stride. I think the plot and characterization and dialogue are very good. And while I could never warm up to the hysterical rescue me type female character the heroes need to save, this author can write realistic women, as Yenava, Klyd's wife is one.If you like buddy style relationships with reluctant heros tasked to save the world, this is a good example of one.There are many other books in the series, but this is the first.

The assassins: A radical sect in Islam,"From a master historian, the definitive account of history's first terrorists An offshoot of the Ismaili Shi'ite sect of Islam, the Assassins were the first group to make systematic use of murder as a political weapon. Established in Iran and Syria in the eleventh and twelfth centuries, they aimed to overthrow the existing Sunni order in Islam and replace it with their own. They terrorized their foes with a series of dramatic murders of Islamic leaders, as well as of some of the Crusaders, who brought their name and fame back to Europe.Professor Lewis traces the history of this radical group, studying its teachings and its influence on Muslim thought. Particularly insightful in light of the rise of the terrorist attacks in the U.S. and in Israel, this account of the Assassins--whose name is now synonymous with politically motivated murderers--places recent events in historical perspective and sheds new light on the fanatic mind.",['Bernard Lewis'],Basic Books,2008,['History'],2.0,5.0,2012-05-07,Research material,"It took me awhile to get the book, considering I kept having to re-order it from different companies....but I finally got it!

Economics in one lesson,"With over a million copies sold, Economics in One Lesson is an essential guide to the basics of economic theory. A fundamental influence on modern libertarianism, Hazlitt defends capitalism and the free market from economic myths that persist to this day. Considered among the leading economic thinkers of the “Austrian School,” which includes Carl Menger, Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich (F.A.) Hayek, and others, Henry Hazlitt (1894-1993), was a libertarian philosopher, an economist, and a journalist. He was the founding vice-president of the Foundation for Economic Education and an early editor of The Freeman magazine, an influential libertarian publication. Hazlitt wrote Economics in One Lesson, his seminal work, in 1946. Concise and instructive, it is also deceptively prescient and far-reaching in its efforts to dissemble economic fallacies that are so prevalent they have almost become a new orthodoxy. Economic commentators across the political spectrum have credited Hazlitt with foreseeing the collapse of the global economy which occurred more than 50 years after the initial publication of Economics in One Lesson. Hazlitt’s focus on non-governmental solutions, strong — and strongly reasoned — anti-deficit position, and general emphasis on free markets, economic liberty of individuals, and the dangers of government intervention make Economics in One Lesson every bit as relevant and valuable today as it has been since publication.",['Henry Hazlitt'],Currency,2010,['Business & Economics'],18.0,5.0,2004-07-14,Great economics starter!,"Having poor public schooling on economics, I decided to pick this book up.

How you see a country depends on whether or not you can leave it, if you have to.As the daughter of white settlers in war-torn 1970s Rhodesia, Alexandra Fuller remembers a time when a schoolgirl was as likely to carry a shotgun as a satchel. This is her story - of a civil war, of a quixotic battle with nature and loss, and of a family's unbreakable bond with the continent that came to define, scar and heal them.Shortlisted for the Guardian First Book Award in 2002, Alexandra Fuller's classic memoir of an African childhood is suffused with laughter and warmth even amid disaster.

Her story of growing up in Africa is an unusual one, and would survive by being character-driven as well as landscape-driven, but due to her well-thought out metaphors and her honest portrayal through the eyes of the child and adolescent that she was, the story flourishes. Her book is despairing, encouraging, cynical, innocent, as varied and buzzing with life as its tropical setting.It was a rough life, with tropical diseases and snakes and political upheaval. Likes so many British colonials, her parents were heavy smokers, drinkers, and partiers. Her father was ever-optimistic: If things didn't work out, they would move on. Her mother, an animal lover, was good to the natives (she ran a weekly medical clinic out of her kitchen back door) but hotly resented the natives' victory over British rule when Rhodesia became Zimbabwe. Her mother bore five children but lost three to disease and accidents, and became mentally unstable for a time.I notice from the back cover notes that Fuller now lives in Wyoming, which strikes me as fitting. One could hardly expect someone with her hardscrabble, adventurous background to become a tame big-city dweller.",0,0

Andrea, an eighteen-year-old orphan, moves in with her volatile Barcelona relatives to attend the local University. Living in genteel squalor in a mysterious house on Calle de Aribau, Andrea relies on her wealthy, beautiful, bohemian friend Ena to prove that normal life exists beyond the gothic dwelling she calls home. In one year, as her innocence melts away, Andrea learns the truth about her overbearing and religious Aunt Angustias, her cruelly sensual, musically gifted uncle Román and his violent brother Juan, and her lovely Aunt Gloria, who provides the family's bread with furtive gambling expeditions. She also learns the truth about Ena—and why her friendship goes hand in hand with her interest in Andrea’s family.

Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance,"THE CLASSIC BOOK THAT HAS INSPIRED MILLIONS A penetrating examination of how we live and how to live better Few books transform a generation and then establish themselves as touchstones for the generations that follow. Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance is one such book. This modern epic of a man’s search for meaning became an instant bestseller on publication in 1974, acclaimed as one of the most exciting books in the history of American letters. It continues to inspire millions. A narration of a summer motorcycle trip undertaken by a father and his son, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance becomes a personal and philosophical odyssey into fundamental questions on how to live. The narrator's relationship with his son leads to a powerful self-reckoning; the craft of motorcycle maintenance leads to an austerely beautiful process for reconciling science, religion, and humanism. Resonant with the confusions of existence, this classic is a touching and transcendent book of life. This new edition contains an interview with Pirsig and letters and documents detailing how this extraordinary book came to be.",['Robert M. Pirsig'],Harper Collins,2009,['Philosophy'],3618.0,5.0,2010-09-24,"""the world of words"" vs. ""the world as animals see it"" and the fundamental duality of consciousness","I think the following passage captures Pirsig's theme:> ""A screw sticks, for example, on a side cover assembly...>> ""If you're experienced you'd probably apply a penetrating liquid and an> impact driver at this point. But suppose you're inexperienced and you attach a> self-locking plier wrench to the shank of your screwdriver and really twist it> hard, a procedure you've had success with in the past, but which this time> succeeds only in tearing the slot of the screw.>> ""Your mind was already thinking ahead to what you would do when the cover> plate was off, and so it takes a little time to realize that this irritating minor> annoyance of a torn screw slot isn't just irritating and minor. You're stuck...>> ""It's a miserable experience emotionally. You're losing time. You're incompetent.> You don't know what you're doing. You should be ashamed of yourself. You should take the machine to a real mechanic who > knows how to figure these things out."" - Ch. 24, pg. 271 [out of 402]Pirsig builds of this common feeling of stuckness--lost keys, test questions that we can't quite remember, computers that don't do what we are telling it, etc. The book opens on a road trip that the author is making with his son Chris, and John and Sylvia, a likable couple who are friends of Pirsig. Chris is riding on the back of his father's motorcycle, John and Sylvia on their BMW. Pirsig knows his bike inside and out, observant of every mechanical nuance that might be a clue toward keeping the motor in top condition. John and Sylvia, however, both are ""stuck"" when it comes to technology (BMW cylces are known for having few mechanical problems on the road), and leave even the smallest jobs to a paid mechanic. Finally Pirsig comprehends why: ""To get away from technology out into the country in the fresh air and sunshine is why they are on the motorcycle in the first place. For me to bring it back to them just at the point and place where they think they have finally escaped it just frosts both of them, tremendously."" (Ch. 1, pg. 8)Pirsig's book presents a theory about the source of John's and Sylvia's exasperation with technology and outlines the foundations for a solution. At this point I feel it necessary to issue a disclaimer. You may be thinking this book sounds like both an enjoyable and illuminating read. And for the first 100 pages you'd be right! The core of the book shifts in style, though it's not necessarily a change for the worse. My disclaimer: ""This book was written for people who like to struggle with ideas."" Pirsig, who also spent four years teaching rhetoric in the Montana and Illinois university systems, admits as much at this point within the book--""I suppose if I were a novelist rather than a Chautauqua orator I'd try to 'develop the characters' of John and Sylvia and Chris... That would be quite a novel, but for some reason I don't feel quite up to it."" (Ch. 12, pg. 129)Webster's defines a Chautauqua as: ""a traveling show or local assembly that flourished in the United States in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, that provided popular education combined with entertainment in the form of lectures, [among other activities]."" This book was written precisely for those individuals who feel excited by the idea of a Chautauqua.The rest of the book is more an autobiography of the author's journey through Western thought than a novel, although it retains many literary elements. Pirsig's insights continued to surprise me through the whole 373 pages. His main concern is the question ""What values does scientific thinking teach us?"" He comes to doubt society's commonly-accepted viewpoint that science teaches only morally-neutral, objective analysis.Pirsig is not satisfied with this answer because for him, science is a means to Truth rather than a means to utilitarian application. Utilitarian application may satisfy most, but Pirsig invested too much in the pursuit of deeper Truth to stop there. To him, the near universal acceptance of utilitarian application as a validation of science, at the expense of the pursuit of a single absolute truth, becomes a ghost that haunts his whole way of thinking. ""Great minds struggle to cure diseases so that people may live longer, but only madmen ask why. One lives longer in order that he may live longer. There is no other purpose. That is what the ghost says."" (Ch. 7, pg. 85)The problem, as he sees it, is that there are infinite possible applications of science, and indeed an infinite number of truths that experimentation can prove. We treat scientific knowledge as an end worthy in itself, but there is no ultimate completeness to be found there. ""It is science itself that is leading mankind from single absolute truths to multiple, indeterminate, relative ones... Science itself is producing the indeterminacy of thought and values that rational knowledge is supposed to eliminate."" (Ch. 10, pg. 108)In this way, science and technology become every bit as subjective as musical taste or religious belief. We use science to extend lifespans and rearrange the elements of the earth into any number of products for physical comfort or electronically-produced amusement in the same way that one prefers Beethoven over Mozart, or Catholicism over Baptists.To avoid facing this inconsistency, Western thought has petrified, insisting that Classicism and Romanticism are mutually exclusive spheres rather than two approaches toward the same end. There's the ""hard"" sectors of science and business, which are ruled by objectivity, and then everything else--the arts, volunteer work, religion. In fact these spheres are different, but it is wrong to think think they have nothing to do with each other, and that the ""hard"" sphere should be controlled only by objective analysis. Classicism develops out of our social predisposition to use language--to learn the accepted name everything and conform to one's cultural grouping. Romanticism comes from humanity's evolutionary, biological need to experiment and experience until arriving at the behavior that feels most right. It is the interaction of these competing worlds that created and has the ability to expand humanity's consciousness. Pirsig explores this fundamental duality of consciousness through the lens of Western philosophical thought, using motorcycle maintenance to explain the Classical mode of dividing and classifying knowledge, and Zen, the Romantic holistic approach.This book is for those who enjoy wrestling with these sort of ideas. In one of the more revealing autobiographical segments, Pirsig employs a quote from Albert Einstein describing an angel who expels the egoists and utilitarians from the Temple of Science. All that remain, ""those who have found favor with the angel,"" are those whose ""finely tempered nature longs to escape from his noisy cramped surroundings into the silence of the mountains where the eye ranges freely through the still pure air and fondly traces out the restful contours apparently built for eternity."" (Ch. 10, pg. 104) For these, I could not recommend ZAMM highly enough.",3,4
Great Expectations,"Penguin Classics e-books give you the best possible editions of Charles Dickens's novels, including all the original illustrations, useful and informative introductions, the definitive, accurate text as it was meant to be published, a chronology of Dickens's life and notes that fill in the background to the book. This Penguin Classics edition of Great Expectations also includes Dickens's alternative ending to the novel. A terrifying encounter with an escaped convict in a graveyard on the wild Kent marshes; a summons to meet the bitter, decaying Miss Havisham and her beautiful, cold-hearted ward Estella; the sudden generosity of a mysterious benefactor - these form a series of events that change the orphaned Pip's life forever, and he eagerly abandons his humble origins to begin a new life as a gentleman. Dickens's haunting late novel depicts Pip's education and development through adversity as he discovers thetrue nature of his 'great expectations'.",['Charles Dickens'],Penguin UK,2003,['Fiction'],2.0,5.0,2006-04-25,"If you've seen any movie of Great Expectations, read the book...","...the defect of almost all the movies (except, perhaps, the 1989 version with Jean Simmons as Miss Havisham (!)) is that the movies emphasize Pip's pursuit of Estella to the exclusion of almost all else. In truth, the core of the story is Pip's class strivings and his inability to distinguish the valuable from the shiny and superficial. Read the book and you will appreciate the character Biddy who is the polar opposite of Estella in every way, and the way, to paraphrase Othello, Pip ""threw a pearl away richer than all he yearned for.""Some of Dickens' characters and coincidences are a little stretched, but they nevertheless are woven together very nicely in the fashion of a good suspense novel. Great Expectations is divided into three volumes, each representing a phase of Pip's Expectations. The structure is strangely like ""The Monkey's Paw"": The first expectation (wish) is for riches; the second expectation finds the granted wish not exactly what the protagonist thought it would be; and the third and final expectation leaves the protagonist trying to pick up the pieces.As another reviewer commented, do get an edition that includes the original ending. It is only a few paragraphs but it wraps up this morality tale in a way that is appropriate to the entire theme of the story. If you wonder where the ""new, happier"" ending was substituted, just look for the place in the very last chapter where Pip suddenly changes direction and makes a lie of what he has just told his family.If you feel that you cannot sit through the novel, then at least get the 1989 film version (though it is out of print--you will have to pay a little more than you might like) and watch it for probably the accurate representations of the various characters, if not some of the stellar performances of the most acclaimed 1946 version. If nothing else, you will see something very rare for any actor or actress--the opportunity to define two characters in the same classic. In 1946, Jean Simmons' Young Estella defined ""beautiful but cruel"" for a generation, and in 1989 the same Ms. Simmons revealed the pain but even greater cruelty of Miss Havisham.",1,1

At first, with no adult supervision, their freedom is something to celebrate. This far from civilization they can do anything they want. Anything.

This narrative technique is used to give a significance to certain people or objects, which represent some other figure.

Another good example of symbolism, brought to my attention by a site visitor, is the shape of the island. The boat shape of the island is an ancient symbol of civilization. The water current around the island seems to be &quot;flowing backwards,&quot; giving the subtle impression that civilization may be going backwards for the island or its inhabitants. Additionally, another reader pointed out that Jack could also represent Communism or Fascism.

Too bad so many people tuned out it's message. Many of the things Claude Brown spoke of in this book about the Harlem of the mid-20th century came to pass in far more communities than Harlem (massive drug addiction, lunatic Black nationalist cults, massive disrespect of women, mindless violece, etc).

Contract as Promise,"Contract as Promise is a study of the philosophical foundations of contract law in which Professor Fried effectively answers some of the most common assumptions about contract law and strongly proposes a moral basis for it while defending the classical theory of contract. This book provides two purposes regarding the complex legal institution of the contract. The first is the theoretical purpose to demonstrate how contract law can be traced to and is determined by a small number of basic moral principles. At the theory level the author shows that contract law does have an underlying, and unifying structure. The second is a pedagogic purpose to provide for students the underlying structure of contract law. At this level of doctrinal exposition the author shows that structure can be referred to moral principles. Together the two purposes support each other in an effective and comprehensive study of contract law. This second edition retains the original text, and includes a new Preface. It also includes a substantial new essay entitled Contract as Promise in the Light of Subsequent Scholarship--Especially Law and Economics which serves as a retrospective of the work accomplished in the last thirty years, while responding to present and future work in the field.",['Charles Fried'],"Oxford University Press, USA",2015,['Contracts'],1.0,5.0,2001-02-08,Should be Required Reading for First Year Law Students,"Professor Fried (former U.S. Solicitor General) is quite possibly the most erudite professor at Harvard Law School. His precision and exacting analysis shine through in his treatment of what some see as a dying academic field, the Law of Contracts. His perspective on the classic cases and extensive treatment of the major doctrinal elements of the subject is absolutely refreshing. Particularly, because his core premise is so intuitive--that it is morally wrong to break one's word and worse yet, to lie, therefore private contracts derive their legal force from essentially, what our parents taught us as children. If you are looking for a break from the typical law school fare or are just curious about what a different perspective looks like, you cannot go wrong with Professor Fried.Also recommended for Law Students: Mary Ann Glendon - Rights Talk",13,14

"Season of life: A football star, a ballboy, a journey to manhood","The bestselling inspirational book in which the author reunites with a childhood football hero, now a minister and coach, and witnesses a revelatory demonstration of the true meaning of manhood. Joe Ehrmann, a former NFL football star and volunteer coach for the Gilman high school football team, teaches his players the keys to successful defense: penetrate, pursue, punish, love. Love? A former captain of the Baltimore Colts and now an ordained minister, Ehrmann is serious about the game of football but even more serious about the purpose of life. Season of Life is his inspirational story as told by Pulitzer Prize–winning journalist Jeffrey Marx, who was a ballboy for the Colts when he first met Ehrmann. Ehrmann now devotes his life to teaching young men a whole new meaning of masculinity. He teaches the boys at Gilman the precepts of his Building Men for Others program: Being a man means emphasizing relationships and having a cause bigger than yourself. It means accepting responsibility and leading courageously. It means that empathy, integrity, and living a life of service to others are more important than points on a scoreboard. Decades after he first met Ehrmann, Jeffrey Marx renewed their friendship and watched his childhood hero putting his principles into action. While chronicling a season with the Gilman Greyhounds, Marx witnessed the most extraordinary sports program he’d ever seen, where players say “I love you” to each other and coaches profess their love for their players. Off the field Marx sat with Ehrmann and absorbed life lessons that led him to reexamine his own unresolved relationship with his father. Season of Life is a book about what it means to be a man of substance and impact. It is a moving story that will resonate with athletes, coaches, parents—anyone struggling to make the right choices in life.",['Jeffrey Marx'],Simon and Schuster,2007,['Sports & Recreation'],4.0,4.0,2007-09-08,All parents and youth coaches should read this book,"I would heartily recommend this book to any parent who has kids involved in youth sports. This is not a book on how to become a coach who wins games. Instead, this is a book that shows how to mold and develop kids who are winners in the game of life.The Gilman football program wins plenty of games. In this book, Jeffrey Marx highlights the coach and former all-pro NFL footballer Joe Ehrmann. As a coach, he finds it more valuable to teach life lessons to his young charges than football lessons. Of course, they do a lot of good football teaching too. And, the coaches know the game very well.The book was written after the 2001 season. The coaches at the time felt that Victor Abiamiri was the player most likely to end up in the NFL. In fact, he is now a rookie on the Philadephia Eagles. I have no idea if any other Gilman players have made the NFL. How many kids on any high school team ever make the NFL? Not many. Victor Abiamiri may be the only NFL player of the bunch. However, I am confident that the all or most of the Gilman kids will become good productive members of society.Of course that is the end result. I recommend you read the story and learn why.",0,0
The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly : A Memoir of Life in Death,"The author, former editor of French Elle magazine, describes the rare stroke to the brain stem that left his mind intact in a nearly totally paralyzed body",['Jean-Dominique Bauby'],Vintage,1998,['Biography & Autobiography'],103.0,4.0,2012-05-02,tres bien,"When I bought my copy of The Diving Bell And The Butterfly it was for research purposes. I intended to write about (and am writing about) someone with locked-in syndrome.To help me decide that this was the book for me, the publishers had generously placed on the cover the recommendation from someone at the FT who had said it was 'one of the great books of the century'.It's certainly a very moving book and, should you want to dig into what is said, a profound one. Reading about someone who can't move their body, has hearing issues and can only use one eye (for seeing and for blinking out the story) it's difficult not to think about life and it's many facets.The story is a surprisingly light read in many ways, a very easy and gentle passage from beginning to end. The style is descriptive and personal, yet slightly removed from real anguish and joy. Hard not to be impressed by Bauby's philosophical stance.Here's a quote about when he first sees his reflection after the massive stroke that left him in his condition:'Not only was I exiled, paralysed, mute, half deaf, deprived of all pleasures and reduced to a jelly-fish existence, but I was also horrible to behold.'There's a rather dry humour in the statement and it's a humour than runs right through the piece.My favourite chapter is about Bauby and a colleague of his who spend a day at the races. The newspaper they run has a sports reporter who knows his horses and the whole of the office is relying on the duo to get their bets down for the big event. The section tells a lot about who Bauby was before the stroke as well as much about how he was afterwards.I was struck by the tenderness and also by the absolute frustration of a man who has young children and how the love they share is tested and stretched. Not to mention that he knows he shan't see his father again - young Bauby is in his prison and his dad is too frail to leave his apartment.There's a reminder right through this that whoever we may be, it's likely that there'll be a time when all our memories are distilled into short measures. The people we have been will have faded and we'll have to manage to make the most of what we are left with and what we remember. It's a reminder that when a person is wheeled passed us that however misshapen or twisted the body might be, the mind might be sharp and active on the inside. And if we need to treat the most vulnerable members of our world with respect, shouldn't we also try and apply such principles to everyone?I work in a school with an 'Exceptional Needs' unit and try to be smiley and positive every time I see the kids there. What I feel I need to do from now is to take that a little further in terms of the communications I offer.Another thing occurred to me as I was reading. It provided an excellent mirror to hold up to Stona Fitch's excellent 'Senseless', highlighting just what a well-written tale that is.It took only a couple of hours to complete and is broken into very neat chapters (I guess the act of blinking out a story is exhausting), but I'd recommend it to anyone who's feeling a little sorry for themselves, anyone who likes descriptions that border on the poetic and anyone who has ever wondered just how bad a Sunday can get.It's not even close to being the greatest book of the century. Maybe not even that close to being the best book of its year, or even month. Still, I think you might benefit from a read of it. Digest it and go out there and try and make the most of your day. I for one will be trying.",2,2
A Lord for Olivia (Signet Regency Romance),"A fresh Signet Regency romance “with a twist” (The Romance Reader), June Calvin’s popular escapade is available as an e-book for the first time. Olivia Ormhill hasn’t trusted a man since she was deceived by her betrothed. Yet there’s something special about the destitute but dashing Lord Edmund. A rakish opportunist, perhaps, but he’s also disarmingly forthright and devilishly appealing. But when her former fiancé returns to take the hot-tempered bluestocking for himself, both Olivia and Edmund must decide what their unspoken passion is worth, and whether they’re willing to wager their hearts for it.",['June Calvin'],Penguin,2012,['Fiction'],1.0,4.0,2009-07-08,"Strong, refreshing, engaging story","This was my first June Calvin novel, but I hope it will not be my last. Edmund's character was well-drawn. He is a rare person in Regency fiction: a moral person who is neither self-righteous prig, bore, nor judge, but an honest, caring, wise, and trustworthy man with a conscience. He decides early on that he will not resort to seduction to win Olivia's love, but will earn it honestly or not at all. He is one of the most appealing heros I have come across.Olivia is highly competent, and strong-willed without ever coming across as a spoiled brat. Her confusion is honest and makes sense. The love that develops between Edmund and Olivia is sincere, honest, serious, and drawn with a fine touch. Another rarity for Regency fiction: no sex scenes! The physical interchanges between Edmund and Olivia are tender, restrained, and absolutely beautiful.The details Calvin provides about haymaking lend a wonderful air of authenticity to the setting.Finally, I deeply appreciated reading a Regency that presented a clergyman in a positive light.I found this story as refreshing and engaging as a Carla Kelly. I recommend it.",5,5

Potent, gripping, and explosive, OUT OF CONTROL is a roller coaster ride of a novel– as a single act of loyalty becomes a desperate struggle for survival. . . . Savannah von Hopf has no choice. To save her uncle’s life, she goes in search of Ken “WildCard” Karmody, a guy she barely knew in college who is now a military operative. She must convince him to help her deliver a cache of ransom money into the hands of terrorists halfway around the world. What she doesn’t expect is to end up in WildCard’s arms before she can even ask for his help. WildCard has always had a soft spot for beautiful women. But when he discovers Savannah’s hidden agenda, he is determined to end the affair. But Savannah is bound for Indonesia with or without his protection, and he can’t just walk away. When her plan goes horribly wrong, they are trapped in the forsaken jungle of a hostile country, stalked by a lethal enemy. As time is running out, they scramble to escape, risking their lives to stop a nightmare from spinning even further out of control. . . .",['Suzanne Brockmann'],Ballantine Books,2002,['Fiction'],17.0,5.0,2002-03-06,When will she finish the next book!,"This was a very, very entertaining book. I read it in one sitting while the housework piled up around me. I stayed up half the night and got up bright and early to grab a cup of coffee and finish it. I have read the whole series and her characters are so human. They have their faults, and they have their strengths. Some of them you like better than others - that's life. Ken Karmody is someone that not everyone likes. He has been portrayed as a man-on-the edge in the past books. The kind of man that lets his emotional baggage weigh him down. But as in life, there truly is someone for everyone (in this case Savannah). As in her other books, there are other relationships developing along the way. I get lost in all of them. I loved Molly and Jones' story. It was so rewarding to FINALLY read about a beautiful woman who does not have a perfect figure. Do you have any idea how long we have been waiting for this? She has laugh lines too! She is not even all that classically pretty. Imagine! Someone sees through this to a beautiful person underneath. The Sam and Allyssa saga continues as she finds him married with baby (and none too contently). I predict Allyssa searching for her Happy Ever After in the arms of her boss, Max, just in time for Sam to realize he's been duped and bail out of his marriage. I think it is brilliant for Suzanne B. to show that life [is bad] sometimes. If he had kept his pants zipped up, he and Allyssa might be together. If she had been honest about her feelings, and not just after about ten drinks, they might be together. Sometimes life isn't so pretty. Sometimes women trap men. Some people may find the language in this book offensive, but not me. I don't believe for a second that Navy SEALS walk around saying darn! or calling their lovers Darling! If you want that, read a Harlequin Romance. This is how men talk when they're together and the dialogue is what makes this story so believable. I love reading a book that shows me how he thinks and how he feels even when he's in tears or paralyzed by insecurities. I think I will find it very hard to read a lot of the other [stuff] that is on the shelf because nothing can compare to this. I guess I'll have to wait until Into the Fire!

There's no ""mystery"" in this mystery novel for the first quarter of the book. No whodunit, no body, no cold crime, no missing person. And that can be tough reading for a mystery fan.However, while we're waiting for ""something"" to happen, Jodi Compton introduces us to an engaging cast: a couple of detectives, a feebee-in-training, a bad guy or two, and the supporting characters. I enjoyed how the author showed us how they react to tragedy and comedy rather than telling us about their personalities.The mystery, when it comes, hits us from an odd direction - it wasn't unexpected so much as unpredicted that it would hit our heroine too close to home. Like a lot of fictional mysteries, the author takes us far into the past to uncover the roots of crime. Like a lot of real life, understanding comes as much from the recent past.Compton does an excellent job of giving us all the clues we need to figure out what's going on (and what's going to happen next), and yet she continued to confound my expectations and predictions.Truth told, there's not much mystery here; this particular book might be better placed in the aisle marked, ""fiction.""

This mainly stems from the fact that my mom gave up reading it at about page 50. From that point on I was determined to read it, to get through it, and to my astonishment, that was not too hard a task. Catch-22 is an hilarious book, one of the most funny books I have ever read, but it goes far beyond that. While reading the novel, the most wide range of emotions will be felt by the reader. You'll laugh at the escapades of Yossarian and his squadron with prostitutes in Rome. You'll fell heartfelt sadness for the dead man in Yossarian's tent, who never even got the chance to unpack his bags, as well as for the memory of Snowden, just a boy who died too young. At times you may be surpirised and confused, but that's the plan. A novel that many consider to be some of the best writing ever done by an American, it does not disappoint. Set at the tail end of World War II, but going beyond pure criticism of the war, Catch-22 will make you laugh, and then cause you to think seriously at what you're laughing about. If your asking yourself whether or not to read Catch-22, condsider what the author himself said about it.

Assassin's Apprentice,"A gorgeously illustrated anniversary edition of the book that launched the epic Farseer Trilogy, praised by George R. R. Martin as “fantasy as it ought to be written” and Lin-Manuel Miranda as “an incredible series,” featuring a new foreword by Robin Hobb and ten illustrations. Twenty-five years ago, Robin Hobb’s first novel featuring FitzChivalry Farseer and his mysterious, often maddening friend the Fool struck like a bolt of brilliant lightning. Thus began a beloved saga spanning multiple series, full of adventure, magic, and sinister plots. To celebrate a quarter-century of wonder, this special edition of Assassin’s Apprentice presents a modern classic as it’s never been seen before: in hardcover, with ten beautiful illustrations by Magali Villeneuve. Young Fitz is the bastard son of the noble Prince Chivalry, raised in the shadow of the royal court by his father’s gruff stableman. He is treated as an outcast by all the royalty except the devious King Shrewd, who has him secretly tutored in the arts of the assassin. For in Fitz’s blood runs the magic Skill—and the darker knowledge of a child raised with the stable hounds and rejected by his family. As barbarous raiders ravage the coasts, Fitz is growing to manhood. Soon he will face his first dangerous, soul-shattering mission. And though some regard him as a threat to the throne, he may just be the key to the survival of the kingdom. Praise for Robin Hobb and Assassin’s Apprentice “Fantasy as it ought to be written . . . Robin Hobb’s books are diamonds in a sea of zircons.”—George R. R. Martin “A gleaming debut in the crowded field of epic fantasies . . . a delightful take on the powers and politics behind the throne.”—Publishers Weekly “This is the kind of book you fall into, and start reading slower as you get to the end, because you don’t want it to be over.”—Steven Brust",['Robin Hobb'],Spectra,2002,['Fiction'],202.0,4.0,2003-12-01,"Very, very good.","Robin Hobb, Assassin's Apprentice (Bantam, 1995)Once you get past the (to be expected with books these days) complete incongruity between the cover art and the book's descriptions of its characters, this is one fine debut novel. I spent way too much time flipping between passages in the book and the cover trying to figure out what planet the artist was on when he took those words and turned them into that cover. But that's just me.Fitz, at the age of (approximately) six, is brought by the person he thinks is his father to the castle at Buckkeep and left there. We are soon apprised that, in fact, Prince Chivalry is Fitz' father, not that chap who dropped him off on the stairs (and this is about as much as we get of Fitz' live previous to his coming to the castle). Fitz is taken in by Burrich, the stablemaster, but soon enough makes himself known to the king. The king decides the boy needs to be made productive, and has him trained in the art of diplomacy from a distance-assassination.Like all good fantasy novels (especially those that come in trilogies), the book is not only about Fitz, of course. It's also about building a believable world in the Six Duchies and the Outislands, and describing it enough that the reader can get a sense of daily life there and a grasp of its geography without going into too much detail and bogging down the story. It is in this that the majority of failed fantasy novels fail. Hobb takes to it like a fish to water (or a Fitz to assassination, as it were), giving us what sometimes seems like an Upstairs, Downstairs set in an alternate world. Fitz' parentage allows him to move between the worlds of royalty and poverty pretty much at will. A tough task for any writer, but Hobb carries it off with aplomb.A fantastic beginning to the trilogy. ****",3,4
Last Train to Paradise: Henry Flagler and the Spectacular Rise and Fall of the Railroad that Crossed an Ocean,"Describes the remarkable and challenging efforts of ambitious entrepreneur Henry Flagler to construct a railway that would connect Key West to the mainland, following the design and engineering of the project, the thousands of workers who brought Flagler's vision to life, and the 1935 hurricane that destroyed the railway. Reprint. 75,000 first printing.",['Les Standiford'],Broadway Books,2003,['History'],15.0,5.0,2008-05-21,If You Love All Things Florida...,"Florida has a long and fascinating history, often overlooked by new arrivals to our fair state, whose attentions seem to focus more on theme parks and the lack of frosty weather than what happened here yesterday or the day before. Les Standiford, whose books are always well written and enjoyable, has provided us with a glimpse of old Florida that is well worth the reader's time and attention, in ""Last Train to Paradise"".The book is an account of Henry Flagler's love for and work in developing Florida, with a special eye toward the building of the Key West Railroad. Flagler, you will recall, was partner with the crusty ""spare-a-dime"" plutocrat John D. Rockefeller in Standard Oil. Upon his semi-retirement, Flagler took up as his hobby railroading; not model railroading, but full-size, fill-the-miles railroading.Many cities along the Atlantic Coast of Florida were founded or revitalized by Flagler's enterprises; for, wherever his railroads went, exotic grand hotels sprang up to which the well-heeled and the curious swiftly flocked. (The First Lady, Mrs. Benjamin Harrison, traveled to St Augustine for the grand opening of the Ponce de Leon Hotel). Indeed, the St. Augustine of today owes more to Henry Flagler for its exotic ambiance as it does to the earliest Spanish settlers. So too, down the coast--from Ormond Beach to Palm Beach--his Florida East Coast Railway and glamorous hotel enterprise sprang, with such speed, vitality and &eacute;lan that Flagler has been called ""the man who built Florida.""Standiford gives a great overview of Flagler and his love for the Sunshine State, and then goes on to tell the compelling story of the building of the Key West Railroad, the only railroad in the world to travel most of its length over open water, instead of land. Originally conceived in a bout of competitive bravura with the Gulf Coast's Henry Plant--at the grand opening of Plant's Tampa Bay Hotel--the Key West Railroad was designed to take travelers in cosseted comfort all the way to the southernmost tip of the United States. Standiford tells the tale of the grueling work that created this modern marvel and of its tragic demise during the horrific hurricane of 1935.All who have traveled to Key West by automobile have benefited from Flagler's vision, since much of the highway was constructed directly upon what remained of the Key West Railroad's foundations.

NOSTROMO (Bantam Classic),"Set in the fictional South American country of Costaguana, this classic story of revolution, deception, and self-betrayal centers on Nostromo, a handsome Italian sailor who, like Costaguana, is being consumed by secret guilt and corruption",['Joseph Conrad'],Bantam Classics,1989,['Fiction'],5.0,5.0,2004-05-23,Capitalism a Century Ago,"Another famous classic by Joseph Conrad, ""Nostromo"" was written a century ago and is still interesting today as a comment about Latin America and foreign involvement.Conrad's tale is set in the harbor town of Sulaco in Costaguana, an imagined place in an imagined country somewhere in South America, plagued by revolutions and greed. Alongside the larger group of natives and other people of color or lower class there is a small core group of Europeans, among those the Goulds. In spite of being third generation South American Charles Gould still goes to England to find a wife. Later when he decides to develop the silver mine he inherits from his father he goes to the United States to find a rich investor. The silver mine becomes a huge success, only to become the target of political revolutionaries, and the story really begins when there is an attempted coup and takeover of the silver mine. Much attention is given to inner conflicts and tough moral choices that individuals are forced to.Detailed descriptions of both characters and settings makes this novel quite a dense reading experience, particularly the first section which contains very little dialogue and reads like a documentary. Only the final section of the novel seemed deserving of the title Nostromo, part one is about Costaguana, part two the Revolution and only in part three does the reader finally become fully acquainted with Gian' Battista, or Nostromo as he is named by the upper class of Sulaco.",4,4

The Opera House in Ankh-Morpork is home to music, theatrics and a harmless masked Ghost who lurks behind the scenes. But now a set of mysterious backstage murders may just stop the show. Agnes Nitt has left her rural home of Lancre in the hopes of launching a successful singing career in the big city. The only problem is, she doesn't quite look the part.

"Shadowdale (Forgotten Realms: Avatar Trilogy, Book One)","An all-new digital version of one of the key titles in the entire Forgotten Realms novel line. At the time of its original release, this series presented key events that impacted the entire Forgotten Realms world, and the effects of those events are still felt in current novels. This re-released series will have a cohesive cover design and all-new art. This title was originally released underneath the author pseudonym Richard Awlinson. When the gods are banished from the heavens, they must travel through Faerûn in the guise of mortals. When four companions, last survivors of the Company of the Lynx, find themselves in possession of a mysterious amulet, they must escape death at the hand of Bane, god of murder. When magic itself runs wild, no one can say that the most innocent of spells will not destroy the world.",['Scott Ciencin'],Wizards of the Coast,2011,['Fiction'],2.0,2.0,2005-03-15,Fails to capitalize on its potential.,"*Note: This review is based on the first 2 books in the series--Shadowdale, and Tantras*I've been an avid reader most of my life, especially fantasy, and lately fantasy set in the Forgotten Realms universe. For those unfamiliar with it, it started as a setting for the Dungeons and Dragons table-top game, and now is a place where many authors have the opportunity to weave their own tales within a world that readers can grow accustomed to. Basically, it allows the world and its people to come alive through the infusion of multiple ideas coming from many different minds.That being said, this series of books covers one of the most momentous happenings in the history of Faerun, the world in which the Forgotten Realms stories takes place. The event to which I refer is the ""Time of Troubles"" or the ""Arrival"" or a multitude of other names penned for it. Without giving too much away, it's the time when there's a shifting in the Pantheon of gods--someone has stolen the Tablets of Fate. As punishment, the power above the gods themselves has cast them out of their otherworldly abode and into the mortal realm, forcing the gods to take on mortal avatars to house their immortal essence. Due to this occurence, magic itself is unstable, causing chaos when it is used, and also creating havoc with the world itself--earthquakes, moving mountains, and random explosions and the like. The story focuses on a group of adventurers, who through chance or fate, have been thrust into the plight of the gods. Sounds like a great start, a wonderful beginning to an epic story, right? WRONG.The first two books are plagued by grossly undercharacterized and overly-cliched heroes. We've got the fighter, Kelemvor, struggling with a secret he dare not reveal to his friends. Midnight, the mage, who seems to be guided by destiny into a fate she isn't sure she wants. Adon, the cleric of Sune, suddenly faced with doubts as to his faith. And Cyric, the thief, haunted by a past he cannot escape. So much potential here, and it's completely undone by Scott Ciencin's inability to craft a story worth reading. Kelemvor's secret is revealed far too early, and the characters basically get over it in a paragraph. Midnight's cloudy fate can be easily guessed by a 10 year old. Adon, who goes into a semi-comatose state for about 2 days, snaps out of it suddenly, no explanation given. He just starts talking. Cyric, who is shown gradually spiraling out of control, had so much potential he practically screamed for a better author to pen him.One of the worst parts, for me at least, occured in the first book. The heroes (Be prepared to hear that a lot. Ciencin can't find anything else to call them but ""the heroes"" or ""the thief"" *snore*) are traveling along, and suddenly a forest sprouts in front of them. Due to the instability in magic and the world at large, the forest not only appears out of the blue, but it also grows upside down; branches are on the ground and roots in the air. The group of adventurers says NOTHING. They go right through it. No debate on if it's dangerous, not even a ""Hey, a forest sprouted upside down right in front of us. Neat."" And NOTHING HAPPENS IN IT. They ride their horses through it for a sentence and keep going.Therein lies the problem. The author is in such a hurry to get to a plot point or action sequence (neither of which are well done) that he rushes over what happens in between. We never get a feel for what these characters go through--the struggles that precede an epic battle, or a sudden revelation. It all feels so rushed.I usually devour books as soon as I get them. I had to keep putting the first book down because it bored me so much, and I NEVER do that. I got the second one on a lark, hoping against hope that it would improve. It doesn't. I'm currently debating whether or not to get the third one, considering that it's Troy Denning who penned that one, and I know he can write.Final Verdict: Read it if you'd like to find out about a momentous event in Faerun's history, one that affects many better books after these. Better yet, find a summary somewhere that lists the important things. I don't recommend this series, and I point you toward Ed Greenwood (the Forgotten realms creator), R.A. Salvatore, or a few others if you'd like to delve into the rich world of Faerun. Scott Ciencin, at least in these 2 books, feels far too much like an adolescent writing a story he thinks his friends would like.",15,20

He manages that rare combination of managing to teach while entertaining. Sometimes his ego and pride come across too strongly, but given the man's accomplishments, I'll cut him slack. And you may wonder why he starts off discussing his days as a chef in Paris, but he does a great job of analogizing that experience to his experiences with running an ad agency.Highly recommended for anyone involved in advertising, particularly copywriters.

The Real Story,"Author of The Chronicles Of Thomas Covenant, one of the most acclaimed fantasy series of all time, master storyteller Stephen R. Donaldson retums with this exciting and long-awaited new series that takes us into a stunningly imagined future to tell a timeless story of adventure and the implacable conflict of good and evil within each of us. Angus Thermopyle was an ore pirate and a murderer; even the most disreputable asteroid pilots of Delta Sector stayed locked out of his way. Those who didn't ended up in the lockup--or dead. But when Thermopyle arrived at Mallory's Bar & Sleep with a gorgeous woman by his side the regulars had to take notice. Her name was Morn Hyland, and she had been a police officer--until she met up with Thermopyle. But one person in Mallorys Bar wasn't intimidated. Nick Succorso had his own reputation as a bold pirate and he had a sleek frigate fitted for deep space. Everyone knew that Thermopyle and Succorso were on a collision course. What nobody expected was how quickly it would be over--or how devastating victory would be. It was common enough example of rivalry and revenge--or so everyone thought.

The author has created and given life to a mythical world and culture with believable details and a sense of ongoing danger that comes from the regular appearance of ""Threadfall,"" an air-borne attack of deadly micro-organisms from a nearby star. This story begins with the heroine, Menolly, being only reluctantly allowed by her parents to use her extraordinary musical talent even though in her isolated home culture of sea-faring fishermen, girls are not allowed to be recognized as having those skills. After her elderly mentor dies and his replacement arrives, however, Menolly's old-fashioned and narrow-minded parents forbid her to have anything to do with music. Faced with a life of drudgery with no music in it, Menolly runs away and lives on her own in a cave, which puts her in the right place at the right time to help a clutch of ""fire lizard"" eggs hatch, and the hatchlings become her inspearable companions. We are given hints that in the broader plot, we will see that fire lizards are very important to this planet, and that Menolly has a hand in something much bigger than herself. Finally, Menolly is rescued from her self-imposed exile, when a flying dragon and its rider rescue her while she is trying to out-run Threadfall (having strayed too far from the cave and gotten caught out in it). But happily, she is whisked away via dragon flight to her bright future in Harper Hall, where music is everything and ""even a girl"" can partake fully in it. This is a delightful coming-of-age story, with a likeable and independent girl as the main character, and a wonderful fantasy setting. I highly recommend it (as well as the other two books in the trilogy, Dragon Singer and Dragon Drummer).",5,6

Running Scared: The Life and Treacherous Times of Las Vegas Casino King Steve Wynn,"Steve Wynn is the former owner of the Bellagio — Las Vegas's latest monument to conspicuous consumption whose hotel and casino contain over $300 million in fine art and $1.5 billion in Wall Street money. He's a mogul whose empire at one point included the Mirage, the Golden Nugget, and Treasure Island. But how did he gain and wield his tremendous power in Nevada?

I know this much is true,"With his stunning debut novel, She's Come Undone, Wally Lamb won the adulation of critics and readers with his mesmerizing tale of one woman's painful yet triumphant journey of self-discovery. Now, this brilliantly talented writer returns with I Know This Much Is True, a heartbreaking and poignant multigenerational saga of the reproductive bonds of destruction and the powerful force of forgiveness. A masterpiece that breathtakingly tells a story of alienation and connection, power and abuse, devastation and renewal--this novel is a contemporary retelling of an ancient Hindu myth. A proud king must confront his demons to achieve salvation. Change yourself, the myth instructs, and you will inhabit a renovated world. When you're the same brother of a schizophrenic identical twin, the tricky thing about saving yourself is the blood it leaves on your bands--the little inconvenience of the look-alike corpse at your feet. And if you're into both survival of the fittest and being your brother's keeper--if you've promised your dying mother--then say so long to sleep and hello to the middle of the night. Grab a book or a beer. Get used to Letterman's gap-toothed smile of the absurd, or the view of the bedroom ceiling, or the influence of random selection. Take it from a godless insomniac. Take it from the uncrazy twin--the guy who beat the biochemical rap. Dominick Birdsey's entire life has been compromised and constricted by anger and fear, by the paranoid schizophrenic twin brother he both deeply loves and resents, and by the past they shared with their adoptive father, Ray, a spit-and-polish ex-Navy man (the five-foot-six-inch sleeping giant who snoozed upstairs weekdays in the spare room and built submarines at night), and their long-suffering mother, Concettina, a timid woman with a harelip that made her shy and self-conscious: She holds a loose fist to her face to cover her defective mouth--her perpetual apology to the world for a birth defect over which she'd had no control. Born in the waning moments of 1949 and the opening minutes of 1950, the twins are physical mirror images who grow into separate yet connected entities: the seemingly strong and protective yet fearful Dominick, his mother's watchful ""monkey""; and the seemingly weak and sweet yet noble Thomas, his mother's gentle ""bunny."" From childhood, Dominick fights for both separation and wholeness--and ultimately self-protection--in a house of fear dominated by Ray, a bully who abuses his power over these stepsons whose biological father is a mystery. I was still afraid of his anger but saw how he punished weakness--pounced on it. Out of self-preservation I hid my fear, Dominick confesses. As for Thomas, he just never knew how to play defense. He just didn't get it. But Dominick's talent for survival comes at an enormous cost, including the breakup of his marriage to the warm, beautiful Dessa, whom he still loves. And it will be put to the ultimate test when Thomas, a Bible-spouting zealot, commits an unthinkable act that threatens the tenuous balance of both his and Dominick's lives. To save himself, Dominick must confront not only the pain of his past but the dark secrets he has locked deep within himself, and the sins of his ancestors--a quest that will lead him beyond the confines of his blue-collar New England town to the volcanic foothills of Sicily 's Mount Etna, where his ambitious and vengefully proud grandfather and a namesake Domenico Tempesta, the sostegno del famiglia, was born. Each of the stories Ma told us about Papa reinforced the message that he was the boss, that he ruled the roost, that what he said went. Searching for answers, Dominick turns to the whispers of the dead, to the pages of his grandfather's handwritten memoir, The History of Domenico Onofrio Tempesta, a Great Man from Humble Beginnings. Rendered with touches of magic realism, Domenico's fablelike tale--in which monkeys enchant and religious statues weep--becomes the old man's confession--an unwitting legacy of contrition that reveals the truth's of Domenico's life, Dominick learns that power, wrongly used, defeats the oppressor as well as the oppressed, and now, picking through the humble shards of his deconstructed life, he will search for the courage and love to forgive, to expiate his and his ancestors' transgressions, and finally to rebuild himself beyond the haunted shadow of his twin. Set against the vivid panoply of twentieth-century America and filled with richly drawn, memorable characters, this deeply moving and thoroughly satisfying novel brings to light humanity's deepest needs and fears, our aloneness, our desire for love and acceptance, our struggle to survive at all costs. Joyous, mystical, and exquisitely written, I Know This Much Is True is an extraordinary reading experience that will leave no reader untouched.",['Wally Lamb'],Harper,1998,['Fiction'],101.0,5.0,2000-09-16,I'll buy it for you...,"This is not so much a review as a plea.

This plot is ridiculous! I like vampire stories as much as the next reader, but as I was reading I couldn't stop thinking this one was a farce. Furthermore, this writing is second-rate. Maybe I was expecting too much from this mystery novel- things like being able to participate in the story, suspense, character development, a little bit of actual unease (as opposed to laughing at the thought of circus performers acting as vampires under the cover of night).On the other hand, as a writer, maybe I'm jealous that Mr. Patterson can successfully get away with such mediocrity.",2,3
Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed),"A literary sensation and runaway bestseller, this brilliant debut novel tells with seamless authenticity and exquisite lyricism the true confessions of one of Japan's most celebrated geisha. Nominated as one of America’s best-loved novels by PBS’s The Great American Read Speaking to us with the wisdom of age and in a voice at once haunting and startlingly immediate, Nitta Sayuri tells the story of her life as a geisha. It begins in a poor fishing village in 1929, when, as a nine-year-old girl with unusual blue-gray eyes, she is taken from her home and sold into slavery to a renowned geisha house. We witness her transformation as she learns the rigorous arts of the geisha: dance and music; wearing kimono, elaborate makeup, and hair; pouring sake to reveal just a touch of inner wrist; competing with a jealous rival for men's solicitude and the money that goes with it. In Memoirs of a Geisha, we enter a world where appearances are paramount; where a girl's virginity is auctioned to the highest bidder; where women are trained to beguile the most powerful men; and where love is scorned as illusion. It is a unique and triumphant work of fiction—at once romantic, erotic, suspenseful—and completely unforgettable.",['Arthur Golden'],Vintage,1999,['Fiction'],1631.0,4.0,2006-03-27,Memoirs of A Geisha,"Memoirs Of A Geisha is an informative novel that will forever remain in the reader's mind. This novel tells the story of a young girl's childhood and continues on until she is an old woman. We see her ascent in Gion as one of the most sought after Geisha's of her time. Although this was a wonderful book in my opinion, it certainly wouldn't appeal to all audiences. A mature female would be most able to appreciate this story.There are many reasons people enjoy books. Some people enjoy the thrill of being scared, others love crying over a heart wrenching Nicolas Sparks novel. However, what makes this book so likable is how relatable it is. The audience most likely has very little knowledge of Japenese culture and of the life of a Geisha; this book is a wonderful introduction to that society. Although the audience may have never even heard of a Geisha, they will be able to relate to the emotions she is forced to deal with: homesickness, grief, loneliness, elation, sexuality, dealing with authority and love.People that enjoyed Chinese Cinderella by Adeline Yen Mah would also enjoy Memoirs of a Geisha. Although Chinese Cinderella doesn't deal with the life of a Geisha, or even Japanese culture, it does introduce the audience to the Oriental world and the differences in lifestyle.The author wrote this novel in the first person. He focused on vivid description to help bring the audience into the setting. However, at times, he described some very disturbing images that stay with the reader. Also, he includes sporadic use of Japenese words which can be difficult to follow, especially since there is no glossary. Even so, Memoirs of a Geisha is a wonderfully informative story sure to captivate the hearts of its readers",3,3
Makes Me Wanna Holler: A Young Black Man in America,"One of our most visceral and important memoirs on race in America, this is the story of Nathan McCall, who began life as a smart kid in a close, protective family in a black working-class neighborhood. Yet by the age of fifteen, McCall was packing a gun and embarking on a criminal career that five years later would land him in prison for armed robbery. In these pages, McCall chronicles his passage from the street to the prison yard—and, later, to the newsrooms of The Washington Post and ultimately to the faculty of Emory University. His story is at once devastating and inspiring, at once an indictment and an elegy. Makes Me Wanna Holler became an instant classic when it was first published in 1994 and it continues to bear witness to the great troubles—and the great hopes—of our nation. With a new afterword by the author",['Nathan McCall'],Vintage,2011,['Biography & Autobiography'],8.0,5.0,2001-12-27,A Warning of Struggle,"My name is Timothy Booker, better known as Booker,Tee.

Throuhout the book I felt like I was right there with him experiencing the same crap. Because of that book I can tell people about things that I never exprienced in my life such as racial discrimination, prison life, and fatherhood. This book is basically a young black man's warning of black struggle in the U.S. Because of this book I have quit messing around with sistas and treated them with more respect than before. I started to be ALOT! more cautious of who I date (especially after reading about Debbie, Nate's ex-wife).Although I have never really faced racial discrimination, I have faced extremely dumb steriotypes about black folks comming from white folks. You see, Amador Valley is a prodominently white school. I attended there sophomore year. On my first day of P.E. class we were playing baseketball. When we were picking teams for a game, I was the first person picked on a team, assumning that since I was black I was good at baseketball. Not only that but I am in no way at all fit for the game of baseketball,but all they saw was the color of my skin.I truely believe that Nathan McCall is a changed man! I don't care what anybody says. The man fell into a ditch and struggled climbing out but he made it! I would love to meet this man. I wouldn't want an autograph or anything like that. I would just like to shake the hand of the man that changed me mentally and spiritually and changed the way I look at life. On behalf of every young black man,I would like to say thank you, Brother Nathan McCAll, for this warning of struggle in this place that should be foreign to our people, America.",3,6

Angels in the Gloom (World War One Series),"With this latest entry in a bestselling series that evokes all the passion and heroism of history’s most heartbreaking conflict–the war that was meant to end all wars–Anne Perry adds new luster to her worldwide reputation. Angels in the Gloom is an intense saga of love, hate, obsession, and murder that features an honorable English family–brothers Joseph and Matthew Reavley and their sisters, Judith and Hannah. In March 1916, Joseph, a chaplain at the front, and Judith, an ambulance driver, are fighting not only the Germans but the bitter cold and the appalling casualties at Ypres. Scarcely less at risk, Matthew, an officer in England’s Secret Intelligence Service, fights the war covertly from London. Only Hannah, living with her children in the family home in tranquil Cambridgeshire, seems safe. Appearances, however, are deceiving. By the time Joseph returns home to Cambridgeshire, rumors of spies and traitors are rampant. And when the savagely brutalized body of a weapons scientist is discovered in a village byway, the fear that haunts the battlefields settles over the town–along with the shadow of the obsessed ideologue who murdered the Reavleys’ parents on the eve of the war. Once again, this icy, anonymous powerbroker, the Peacemaker, is plotting to kill. Perry’s kaleidoscopic new novel illuminates an entire world, from the hell of the trenches to the London nightclub where a beautiful Irish spy plies her trade; from the sequestered laboratory where a weapon that can end the war is being perfected to the matchless glory of the English countryside in spring.

The Grays is a mind-bending journey behind the curtain of secrecy that surrounds the subject of aliens, written by the field's great master, Whitley Strieber.

There were a couple of slow parts which I just daydreamed through but overall I was particularly enthralled with this book and the idea of the human race being saved by a little boy. I couldn't help but wonder what would it be like to be his mother and how would I react to all the craziness that came my way. I was particularly happy with the ending for most of the science fiction books I have read lately have been such a downer.....but this book gave me hope and was filled with hope in the midst of danger....and I felt relief in finding a book that would end on a high note.Thanks to this little novel my hope in science fiction reads has been restored again.,0,0

Great Expectations,"Penguin Classics e-books give you the best possible editions of Charles Dickens's novels, including all the original illustrations, useful and informative introductions, the definitive, accurate text as it was meant to be published, a chronology of Dickens's life and notes that fill in the background to the book. This Penguin Classics edition of Great Expectations also includes Dickens's alternative ending to the novel. A terrifying encounter with an escaped convict in a graveyard on the wild Kent marshes; a summons to meet the bitter, decaying Miss Havisham and her beautiful, cold-hearted ward Estella; the sudden generosity of a mysterious benefactor - these form a series of events that change the orphaned Pip's life forever, and he eagerly abandons his humble origins to begin a new life as a gentleman.

Since that was an idealistic romance novel, this book rather surprised me with its portrayals of the darker side of human nature. Instead of heart-wrending sacrifices, I found painful ingratitude. Instead of perfect heroines, I found scheming, insensitive women. This book was not anything I expected with regards to characterization and theme. However, I would have to say this book exemplifies human nature much, much better. It was not a very entertaining read at all, but the craftsmanship and word employment simply could not be better. This book may not turn one's daydreams on paper, but it is a solid, landmark work of literature.",0,0

Modern American usage: A guide,"Since first appearing in 1998, Garner's Modern American Usage has established itself as the preeminent guide to the effective use of the English language. Brimming with witty, erudite essays on troublesome words and phrases, GMAU authoritatively shows how to avoid the countless pitfalls that await unwary writers and speakers whether the issues relate to grammar, punctuation, word choice, or pronunciation. An exciting new feature of this third edition is Garner's Language-Change Index, which registers where each disputed usage in modern English falls on a five-stage continuum from nonacceptability (to the language community as a whole) to acceptability, giving the book a consistent standard throughout. GMAU is the first usage guide ever to incorporate such a language-change index. The judgments are based both on Garner's own original research in linguistic corpora and on his analysis of hundreds of earlier studies. Another first in this edition is the panel of critical readers: 120-plus commentators who have helped Garner reassess and update the text, so that every page has been improved. Bryan A. Garner is a writer, grammarian, lexicographer, teacher, and lawyer. He has written professionally about English usage for more than 28 years, and his work has achieved widespread renown. David Foster Wallace proclaimed that Bryan Garner is a genius and William Safire called the book excellent. In fact, due to the strength of his work on GMAU, Garner was the grammarian asked to write the grammar-and-usage chapter for the venerable Chicago Manual of Style. His advice on language matters is second to none.",['Bryan Garner'],"Oxford University Press, USA",2009,['Language Arts & Disciplines'],2.0,5.0,1998-12-05,"Helpful, elegant, amusing...","An enjoyable book.

An Act of State: The Execution of Martin Luther King,"The definitive account of Martin Luther King, Jr.’s assassination On April 4, 1968, Martin Luther King was in Memphis to support a workers’ strike. As night fell, army snipers took up position; military officers surveilled the scene from a nearby roof; and their accomplice, restaurant-owner Loyd Jowers, was ready to remove the murder weapon. When the dust had settled, King had been shot and a cleanup operation was in motion—James Earl Ray was framed, the crime scene was destroyed, and witnesses were killed. It would take William F. Pepper, attorney and friend of King, thirty years to get to the bottom of a conspiracy that changed the course of American history. In 1999, the King family, represented by the author, brought a civil action lawsuit against Loyd Jowers and other co-conspirators. Seventy witnesses set out the details of a plot that involved J. Edgar Hoover and the FBI, Richard Helms and the CIA, the US military, the Memphis police, and organized crime. The jury took an hour to find for the King family. Now fifty years after MLK’s execution, An Act of State demonstrates the bloody depths to which the US government will descend to repress a movement for change.",['William F. Pepper'],Verso Books,2018,['Political Science'],2.0,5.0,2007-06-19,This should be taught in all schools,"I rode once in a pickup truck associated with a black college professor running for a city council seat, which was soot blackened because it had been fire bombed. That was in the early 1980s in a progressive university town. The threat of violence in reaction to political activism is not academic. It is out there and it is real.It is chilling that one of Peppers' interviewees matter of factly states that he thinks the book will be buried, so his testimony can just be part of a record without his drawing consequence from providing it. The mainstream media certainly does bury stories that don't fit an establishment narrative. That they have done so in this case shall be a stain on the Fourth Estate for all time.This is an important work. Every citizen should read this, and it should be taught in all the schools along with material on who King was. One of the things that Pepper does best, in addition to show a lot of persistence in seeking evidence, is reflect on King's value as one of America's leading thinkers of all time.Given the state of the world, King's moral force is no less and his call to action to bring America back to its original vision still rings out like the echoing of the Liberty Bell.I think that Pepper's work brings a lot of implications that need to be seriously addressed, especially since there might be some sort of connections or parallels to the JFK and RFK assassinations. What does this mean for any attempt to gain power for a more progressive vision of America in the future? What can we do to make sure our civil processes are not to be trumped by those with a will to do violence in response?",14,18

"Design of Reinforced Concrete Structures, 2nd Edition","This revised, fully updated second edition covers the analysis, design, and construction of reinforced concrete structures from a real-world perspective. It examines different reinforced concrete elements such as slabs, beams, columns, foundations, basement and retaining walls and pre-stressed concrete incorporating the most up-to-date edition of the American Concrete Institute Code (ACI 318-14) requirements for the design of concrete structures. It includes a chapter on metric system in reinforced concrete design and construction. A new chapter on the design of formworks has been added which is of great value to students in the construction engineering programs along with practicing engineers and architects. This second edition also includes a new appendix with color images illustrating various concrete construction practices, and well-designed buildings. The ACI 318-14 constitutes the most extensive reorganization of the code in the past 40 years. References to the various sections of the ACI 318-14 are provided throughout the book to facilitate its use by students and professionals. Aimed at architecture, building construction, and undergraduate engineering students, the scope of concepts in this volume emphasize simplified and practical methods in the analysis and design of reinforced concrete. This is distinct from advanced, graduate engineering texts, where treatment of the subject centers around the theoretical and mathematical aspects of design. As in the first edition, this book adopts a step-by-step approach to solving analysis and design problems in reinforced concrete. Using a highly graphical and interactive approach in its use of detailed images and self-experimentation exercises, “Concrete Structures, Second Edition,” is tailored to the most practical questions and fundamental concepts of design of structures in reinforced concrete. The text stands as an ideal learning resource for civil engineering, building construction, and architecture students as well as a valuable reference for concrete structural design professionals in practice.","['Mehdi Setareh', 'Robert Darvas']",Springer,2016,['Technology & Engineering'],1.0,4.0,2001-11-01,Design of Reinforced Concrete Structure,Is a good book for the engeneering civil.....,0,1
The Razor's Edge: A Novel,"Larry Darrell is a young American in search of the absolute. The progress of this spiritual odyssey involves him with some of Maugham's most brillant characters - his fiancee Isabel, whose choice between love and wealth have lifelong repercussions, and Elliot Templeton, her uncle, a classic expatriate American snob. The most ambitious of Maugham's novels, this is also one in which Maugham himself plays a considerable part as he wanders in and out of the story, to observe his characters struggling with their fates.",['William Somerset Maugham'],Random House,2000,['Americans'],50.0,4.0,2010-03-02,The Razor's Edge,"THE RAZOR'S EDGE is a fine read; a well told story with characters that are like real people. I believe Maugham used real persons as his inspiration for this novel, but only a master of fictional characterization could have adapted the 'real' so adroitly.The plot opens circa 1919, in Chicago, with Larry Darrell, a young aviator who's experienced too much war and is mentally still trying to recover. He's engaged to Isabel, a moderately well-to-do young woman, whose family - her down-to-earth mother and wealthy sophisticated uncle, Elliot Templeton - would like to see Larry settled into a job and the usual lifestyle of a young American male (i.e., striving to make a success of his career). Larry resists this line of thought, and ultimately sets out on a journey of exploration, eventually coming to the realisation with Isabel that their engagement must end.The story moves up to 1929-1930, with Isabel, now married to an old friend of Larry's, having moved to Paris at her uncle Elliot's request, following the financial crash of 1929 and her husband's mental & physical breakdown. Larry's separation from this way of life; what's happened on his journeys through Europe and India, are woven into what is occurring with Isabel and her family, and with Elliot.This bare-bones plot description doesn't really begin to go into all the nuances of the story and the subtleties of these characters that Maugham creates. Elliot Templeton, in particular, is a wonderful creation. Elliot's multifaceted; he could be easily dismissed as a shallow ""snob"", or as comical in his complete immersion in society and high life, when in fact, he's also (aside from being somewhat snobbish, and somewhat comical because of his preoccupations), a kind-hearted, canny, generous and thoughtful man. He's also self-made, a person who saw what he wanted and reinvented himself to achieve his goal.Personally, I enjoyed reading about Elliot much more than I did reading about Larry's journey of discovery. I enjoyed the way the novel is written, especially that Maugham made himself a character with these characters. Without trying to reveal too much of the storyline, Isabel is slowly revealed to be quite a monster of selfishness. (Larry has a lucky escape.)Some readers may take Larry's confusion and his rejection of a routine, settled life to heart, and take inspiration from his life's journey, but by the end of the story, I didn't think Larry was maturing. I thought he remained insular; completely self-absorbed for most of the time, both on and off the page. Yes, he helps certain characters, but he didn't give anything emotionally (he doesn't ever seem capable of love). (SPOILER ALERT):I would have hoped that by the end of his ten years or so of reading, thinking, and exploring the world - and I was not seeking a Hollywood ending - Larry would have found, not ALL the answers, but would have found in himself a feeling that he needed to give more to people in a definite way, both emotionally and in a practical sense (practical as he did for the character of Suzanne). Instead of remaining a drifter, ""living"" for himself alone - I thought he should be, at the least, actively seeking out the troubled, the sick, the lonely, instead of letting them just happen upon him. Even giving away his inheritance, the money which allowed him to seek and roam the world, could be viewed as a selfish act - in that in the middle of the Depression, he was setting off back to America with nothing, and likely wouldn't be able to find work, and therefore be a burden on others for food & shelter. The episode with Sophie troubled me. Larry could have pursued her, devoted himself to her. His marriage to her could have been an act of unselfishness; become true love. (They had their childhood connection to build on.) Instead he lets her go.(END OF SPOILER)Larry was always distant from people - would not always make the effort to talk to them at length, even - removed himself from them quickly, several times; wouldn't share his address. Just ""living"", as Larry does, (drifting around, seeking out answers and/or knowledge) is not enough. If we all ""lived"" in such a way, there would be no grace in this world. We need to actively seek out and reach out to people, also. The Larry character is always seeking, but he seldom reaches out.Despite my personal dissatisfaction with Larry Darrell's journey 'round the philosophical world and its end result, this is a rich story and so well told, by such a skillful author, that I recommend it highly.",1,1

Autobiography of a Face,"In this celebrated memoir and exploration of identity, cancer transforms the author’s face, childhood, and the rest of her life. At age nine, Lucy Grealy was diagnosed with a potentially terminal cancer. When she returned to school with a third of her jaw removed, she faced the cruel taunts of classmates. It took her twenty years of living with a distorted self-image and more than thirty years of reconstructive procedures before she could come to terms with her appearance. In this lyrical and strikingly candid memoir, Grealy tells her story of great suffering and remarkable strength without sentimentality and with considerable wit. She captures what it is like as a child and a young adult to be torn between two warring impulses: to feel that more than anything else we want to be loved for who we are, while wishing desperately and secretly to be perfect.

She pulled us in so that we had sympathy no matter how much her words and tone insisted she did not want sympathy. Then she would abruptly turn and show us the ugliness of disease, as if to say, ""Here, you will look. I will not let you turn away.""Particularly jarring was the chapter ironically entitled ""The Petting Zoo.""

The Courage to Be,"“Marie Kondo, but for your brain.” —HelloGiggles “Compelling from front to back. Highly recommend.” —Marc Andreessen Reading this book could change your life. The Courage to Be Disliked, already an enormous bestseller in Asia with more than 3.5 million copies sold, demonstrates how to unlock the power within yourself to be the person you truly want to be. Is happiness something you choose for yourself? The Courage to Be Disliked presents a simple and straightforward answer. Using the theories of Alfred Adler, one of the three giants of nineteenth-century psychology alongside Freud and Jung, this book follows an illuminating dialogue between a philosopher and a young man. Over the course of five conversations, the philosopher helps his student to understand how each of us is able to determine the direction of our own life, free from the shackles of past traumas and the expectations of others. Rich in wisdom, The Courage to Be Disliked will guide you through the concepts of self-forgiveness, self-care, and mind decluttering. It is a deeply liberating way of thinking, allowing you to develop the courage to change and ignore the limitations that you might be placing on yourself. This plainspoken and profoundly moving book unlocks the power within you to find lasting happiness and be the person you truly want to be. Millions have already benefited from its teachings, now you can too.","['Ichiro Kishimi', 'Fumitake Koga']",Simon and Schuster,2018,['Self-Help'],3.0,2.0,2008-07-27,No Exit,"Tillich believes that modern man's predominant anxiety is a sense of meaninglessness leading to despair. This is the Existentialist's plight. Tillich states that meaninglessness has not always been the predominant concern. In prior ages it had been death and later guilt.In order to resolve the angst of modern man, Tillich imposes upon himself that ""The answer must accept, as its precondition, the state of meaninglessness."" This precondition creates the cul-de-sac for his rational argument.Tillich himself, offers the nave solution of ""The faith which creates the courage to take [meaninglessness/anxiety] into itself has no special content. It is simply faith, undirected, absolute. It is undefinable, since everything defined is dissolved by doubt and meaninglessness.""In other words, Tillich suggests that to resolve meaninglessness and despair one should resort to having faith without subject matter.Tillich further explains himself by stating the requisite courage/faith is not without subject matter but rather is in ""pure being"" or ""the God above God"". This is nonsense. The God of the Bible is the great ""I AM"", pure being. There is no God above God.By giving the proposition ""God above God"" Tillich is either:a) making a substitution identical to that which is being substituted, making the proposition gibberishb) removing God from the equation, replacing Him with the power of being within ourselves as the basis for our courage (what an ersatz this exchange would be, a finite force within ourselves, leading to certain death, rather than a personal God who could be implored that held the power to gift eternity).orc) replacing the definition of God handed down through the ages and substituting it for one, more amenable to his existentialist philosophy. In so doing he is falling into the trap of creating god in his own image. One also would have to ask the question why he feels he should be trusted with elucidating to mankind who God is, using his reason alone? The credentials of Jesus and Moses are likely more qualified for this which is likely why their assertions are believed more than those of Tillich.If you were not certain before reading this book that Existentialist philosophy has no real legitimate answers for meaning in life this book should provide another nail in the coffin towards that conclusion.",12,27
Bitterroot,"Following his acclaimed bestseller Purple Cane Road, James Lee Burke returns with a triumphant tour de force. Set in the Bitterroot Valley of Montana, home to celebrities seeking to escape the pressures of public life, as well as to xenophobes dedicated to establishing a bulkhead of patriotic paranoia, Burke’s novel features Billy Bob Holland, former Texas Ranger and now a Texas-based lawyer, who has come to Big Sky Country for some fishing and ends up helping out an old friend in trouble. And big trouble it is, not just for his friend but for Billy Bob himself—in the form of Wyatt Dixon, a recent prison parolee sworn to kill Billy Bob as revenge for both his imprisonment and his sister's death, both of which he blames on the former Texas lawman. As the mysteries multiply and the body count mounts, the reader is drawn deeper into the tortured mind of Billy Bob Holland, a complex hero tormented by the mistakes of his past and driven to make things—all things—right. But beneath the guise of justice for the weak and downtrodden lies a tendency for violence that at times becomes more terrifying than the danger he is trying to eradicate. As USA TODAY noted in discussing the parallels between Billy Bob Holland and Burke’s other popular series hero, David Robicheaux, “Robicheaux and Holland are two of a kind, white-hat heroes whose essential goodness doesn’t keep them from fighting back. The two series describe different landscapes, but one theme remains constant: the inner conflict when upright men are provoked into violence in defense of hearth, home, women, and children. There are plenty of parallels. Billy Bob is an ex-Texas Ranger; Dave is an ex-New Orleans cop. Dave battles alcoholism and the ghosts of Vietnam; Billy Bob actually sees ghosts, including the Ranger he accidentally gunned down....But most of all, both protagonists hold a vision of a pure and simple life.” In Bitterroot, with its rugged and vivid setting, its intricate plot, and a set of remarkable, unforgettable characters, and crafted with the lyrical prose and the elegiac tone that have inspired many critics to compare him to William Faulkner, James Lee Burke has written a thriller destined to surpass the success of his previous novels.",['James Lee Burke'],Simon and Schuster,2001,['Fiction'],11.0,5.0,2002-04-12,BITTERROOD,"THIS IS BILLY BOB AT HIS BEST.

WATERSHIP DOWN - AVON #19810,An allegorical tale of survival in which a band of wild rabbits leave their ancestral home to build a more humane society,['Richard Adams'],Avon Books,1975,['Fiction'],243.0,5.0,1999-09-04,Undisputedly one of the best books ever written.,"I cannot describe in less than one million words just what I thought of this masterpiece, and I do not mean to flatter the author. His portrayal of rabbits with &quot;human traits and tendencies&quot; soared over the undiscovered frontier of literature with such freedom that no force of gravity could have this story suffer a swift and sudden fall from grace. The rabbits and their distinctive names and terms, and their legendary hero (El-ahrairah) were all characters within one of the most creative stories ever told. Just forget Brer Rabbit and Bugs Bunny; they're lone &quot;wolves&quot; who only get themselves into mischief, and don't believe in forming partnerships. They cannot compare to the wonderful way in which these rabbits stick together as they wander the wilderness throughout the story, enduring conflict with different societies, as they search for a new &quot;warren&quot; in which to run their lives after fleeing from a doomed society falling to the cruelty of mankind. It was very different to step out of man's shoes and see mankind through the eyes of rabbits. Never before have I read such a beautiful story with such a universal appeal. I believe that this should be read by all students in school who are able to read at the level at which it is written, and young and old folks alike should get as much enjoyment from it also. It touched my heart and made me value respect for all God's creatures living together on the earth that He made for us. Thank you, Mr. Adams, for reminding us all that rabbits, like humans, need to use earth's resources to survive also. Now, if only someone would write a story about life seen through the eyes of...say, eagles, an endangered species.",1,2

Her hero is the somewhat unlikely Albert Campion, man of mystery and well-hidden talents. The time is between the First and Second World Wars in England.In the Black Dudley Murder, Campion is part of a house party at the forbidding Black Dudley mansion, where murder is committed during an after-dinner game. And there could be no better setting for the crime than in the Black Dudley, where secret passageways abound, few of the players are what they seem, and rescue comes from the least expected sources...If you have never read an Allingham mystery, then this is a wonderful introduction, and will encourage you to buy more of her work.

The Tragedy of Great Power Politics,"Presents the author's theory of ""offensive realism,"" declaring the post-Cold War visions of international peace and prosperity unrealistic and explaining how great power politics force states to seek dominance at one another's expense. Reprint.",['John J. Mearsheimer'],W. W. Norton & Company,2003,['Political Science'],4.0,1.0,2008-10-14,Not seeing the trees for the wood,"John Mearsheimer's Tragedy of Great Power Politics is a disappointing work and the title itself is somewhat anachronistic. It is easy to indulge in self prophesy and to see the wood (the already verifiable truth that nations understand the language of force) but it is not wise to miss the trees, that is, the recent challenges to realistic theories like globalization, growth of multilateral institutions and regimes, etc. Is it not a futile exercise at a time to rehash great power politics when there is no great power worth the name round the corner.No doubt much of what Dr. Mearsheimer says on offensive realism is as true as the fact that groups and individuals try to dominate others to enhance their powers which has ,paradoxically, a root in the survival issue. His theory is based on a long tried and popular school of thought, 'realism' which has proved right time and again. But one must look beyond. Human civilization has its history as much in force as in cooperation.Neither can one ignore the fact that eternal vigilance is the price of freedom. So, self defense and cooperation act as s check on other aspiring powers. Just look at the Chinese 'Himalayan' patience at the sight of the US fleet roaming that region. This is another face of realism, that is, 'defensive realism'.Moreover, history might provide useful data and conclusions but one must remember history is era-specific and written by personalities belonging to a particular era. It is necessary to leave opinionated approaches in erecting theories because time and future constantly unfolds, not always, to the liking or prediction of any human being. That is the beauty and essence of human society and civilization.This is not to say that the era of great power politics is over. It is not. The weight of history is rather very much in favor of this. History has proved that wars are realities and peace illusive. But each time a war is fought the goal is peace. In the post cold war era is it not wise to increase the horizon of peace tools when we are having a long peace since the end of the Second world War?Gautam MaitraAuthor of 'Tracing the Eagle's Orbit: Illuminating Insights into Major US Foreign Policies since Independence'.",3,22

Nominated as one of America’s best-loved novels by PBS’s The Great American Read Speaking to us with the wisdom of age and in a voice at once haunting and startlingly immediate, Nitta Sayuri tells the story of her life as a geisha. It begins in a poor fishing village in 1929, when, as a nine-year-old girl with unusual blue-gray eyes, she is taken from her home and sold into slavery to a renowned geisha house. We witness her transformation as she learns the rigorous arts of the geisha: dance and music; wearing kimono, elaborate makeup, and hair; pouring sake to reveal just a touch of inner wrist; competing with a jealous rival for men's solicitude and the money that goes with it. In Memoirs of a Geisha, we enter a world where appearances are paramount; where a girl's virginity is auctioned to the highest bidder; where women are trained to beguile the most powerful men; and where love is scorned as illusion.

Education of a wandering man,"From his decision to leave school at fifteen to roam the world, to his recollections of life as a hobo on the Southern Pacific Railroad, as a cattle skinner in Texas, as a merchant seaman in Singapore and the West Indies, and as an itinerant bare-knuckled prizefighter across small-town America, here is Louis L'Amour's memoir of his lifelong love affair with learning—from books, from yondering, and from some remarkable men and women—that shaped him as a storyteller and as a man. Like classic L'Amour fiction, Education of a Wandering Man mixes authentic frontier drama--such as the author's desperate efforts to survive a sudden two-day trek across the blazing Mojave desert--with true-life characters like Shanghai waterfront toughs, desert prospectors, and cowboys whom Louis L'Amour met while traveling the globe. At last, in his own words, this is a story of a one-of-a-kind life lived to the fullest . . . a life that inspired the books that will forever enable us to relive our glorious frontier heritage.","[""Louis L'Amour""]",Bantam,2008,['Biography & Autobiography'],26.0,3.0,2003-10-06,Mr. Roberts Class,"This Book was not my favorite book i have ever read, but it did have some parts that really pulled me in like the part at the mine and then going through the dessert.

"Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)","The Wheel of Time ® is a PBS Great American Read Selection! Now in development for TV! Since its debut in 1990, The Wheel of Time® by Robert Jordan has captivated millions of readers around the globe with its scope, originality, and compelling characters. The Wheel of Time turns and Ages come and go, leaving memories that become legend. Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth returns again. In the Third Age, an Age of Prophecy, the World and Time themselves hang in the balance. What was, what will be, and what is, may yet fall under the Shadow. Fleeing from Ebou Dar with the kidnapped Daughter of the Nine Moons, whom he is fated to marry, Mat Cauthon learns that he can neither keep her nor let her go, not in safety for either of them, for both the Shadow and the might of the Seanchan Empire are in deadly pursuit. Perrin Aybara seeks to free his wife, Faile, a captive of the Shaido, but his only hope may be an alliance with the enemy. Can he remain true to his friend Rand and to himself? For his love of Faile, Perrin is willing to sell his soul. At Tar Valon, Egwene al'Vere, the young Amyrlin of the rebel Aes Sedai, lays siege to the heart of Aes Sedai power, but she must win quickly, with as little bloodshed as possible, for unless the Aes Sedai are reunited, only the male Asha'man will remain to defend the world against the Dark One, and nothing can hold the Asha'man themselves back from total power except the Aes Sedai and a unified White Tower. In Andor, Elayne Trakland fights for the Lion Throne that is hers by right, but enemies and Darkfriends surround her, plotting her destruction. If she fails, Andor may fall to the Shadow, and the Dragon Reborn with it. Rand al'Thor, the Dragon Reborn himself, has cleansed the Dark One's taint from the male half of the True Source, and everything has changed. Yet nothing has, for only men who can channel believe that saidin is clean again, and a man who can channel is still hated and feared-even one prophesied to save the world. Now, Rand must gamble again, with himself at stake, and he cannot be sure which of his allies are really enemies.

But even as the Pentagon's chain of command becomes a noose around his neck, Marcinko begins to cut and slash his way to the truth behind Mahon's death.

For her first book, Morrison managed to incorporate the elements of race and gender injustices and wove it with the reality of social stratification during that era for an unforgettable story. Pecola Breedlove is the tortured main character whose life is peppered with the pressures of falling short of the glory and the repercussions of being on the cusp of society's sometimes cruel and unforgiving standards of beauty.

Feet of Clay: Discworld #19,"It's murder in Discworld!—which ordinarily is no big deal. But what bothers Watch Commander Sir Sam Vimes is that the unusual deaths of three elderly Ankh-Morporkians do not bear the clean, efficient marks of the Assassins' Guild. An apparent lack of any motive is also quite troubling. All Vimes has are some tracks of white clay and more of those bothersome ""clue"" things that only serve to muck up an investigation. The anger of a fearful populace is already being dangerously channeled toward the city's small community of golems—the mindless, absurdly industrious creatures of baked clay, who can occasionally be found toiling in the city's factories.

And I loved it. It started a bit slow while I sorted out the enormous cast and the author built up the historical backdrop, but the characters are so strongly drawn and the details of court life are so fascinating that I found myself staying up all night to keep reading. I think I'd call it a mystery first and foremost, not specifically a love story--I'm not sure which loose ends should have been tied up because the author answered all questions about who did what to whom. The missing boy was DEAD (this won't be a spoiler), and I didn't need Koen to spell it out to make it more obvious. Give DARK ANGELS a chance on its own merits and you won't be sorry. Alice springs to life almost instantly and even though she's not universally admirable, she's always fascinating. The book is complex, brilliantly plotted, engrossing, engaging, and even--dare I say it?--educational with all the intimate, intricate details of life in Charles II's court. I was afraid that she wouldn't wrap up the love story to my personal expectations but, relief, she did.

The Tao of Pooh,"An expert in Chinese philosophy explains facets of Taoism using Milne's famous character and explores the world of Winnie-the-Pooh through Tao, characterizing Pooh as a simple bear who subscribes to the principles of successful living",['Benjamin Hoff'],Penguin Group USA,1983,['Humor'],123.0,5.0,2001-03-30,Makes you realize the important things in life,"I first read The Tao of Pooh in my sophomore year of high school, which is one of those &quot;in-between&quot; years where it's simply difficult to keep your head above the water at any given moment. Stress of school, family, the pressure to fit in...it all winds up consuming you at that age. Benjamin Hoff's book reminded me of the important things in life- the simple things- and how much time was wasted on the little unimportant parts. I didn't read a lot of Pooh when I was a kid, but it isn't necessary to fully enjoy this book. To this day, I pull it out whenever I need a reminder to breathe and to just enjoy the day to day of life. My favorite quote:The clouds above us join and separate, the breeze in the courtyard leaves and returns. Life is like that, so why not relax? Who can stop us from celebrating? -Lu YuAnd that's what The Tao of Pooh is about.",3,5
Brave New World,"Brave New World predicts - with eerie clarity - a terrifying vision of the future. Read the dystopian classic that inspired the Sky TV series. EVERYONE BELONGS TO EVERYONE ELSE Welcome to New London. Everybody is happy here. Our perfect society achieved peace and stability through the prohibition of monogamy, privacy, money, family and history itself. Now everyone belongs. You can be happy too. All you need to do is take your Soma pills. Discover the brave new world of Aldous Huxley's classic novel, written in 1932, which prophesied a society which expects maximum pleasure and accepts complete surveillance - no matter what the cost. 'A masterpiece of speculation... As vibrant, fresh, and somehow shocking as it was when I first read it' Margaret Atwood, bestselling author of The Handmaid's Tale 'A grave warning... Provoking, stimulating, shocking and dazzling' Observer **One of the BBC's 100 Novels That Shaped Our World**",['Aldous Huxley'],Random House,2008,['Fiction'],2713.0,5.0,2008-03-30,"Way Ahead of its time, and durable","This novel is a biting critique of the over-scientification of the emerging modern world, and in particular a scathing critique of early movements towards behavioral conditioning, as well as towards psychoanalysis, mass production, the use of drugs to affect and modify behavior, as well as mass consumerism, all of which had begun to appear around the turn of the 20th Century.Huxley creates an imaginary ""overly controlled,"" ""overly conditioned"" and ""overly bureaucratized"" utopia, one that was supposed to produce world stability and unattainable and unimaginable individual happiness under a regime of benign tyranny. However, when judged by the results and effects on its inhabitants, the utopia turns out to be just the opposite: an avowed dystopia.Mustapha Mond, one of the characters and a member of the ruling elite had decided that all of art must be sacrificed in order to increase the overall happiness of the society. But in a discussion with an inhabitant who existed on the margins of the managed state, he was surprised to learn that the individual, the character, John Savage, disagreed with him and made the radical claim that in order to be free, and even to maximize happiness, people must be allowed the right to be unhappy as well to be happy.From before birth until they were in the grave, the lives of the inhabitants of Huxley's imaginary London were conditioned so that every aspect of their lives were carefully managed by strict rules and by state administered drugs to create the kind of behavior that best suited the needs of those ruling the state. Even fetuses were treated chemically to produce the kind of intelligence that the ruling bureaucrats had decided were in the best interests of the kind of societal stratifications and chosen roles within society that the ruling elites had decided were necessary.American satire rarely gets better than this and not since George Orwell's Animal Farm and his equally effective, 1984, has a single piece of political fiction sounded as many cautionary alarm bells as this cautionary tale. It has proven amazingly durable and prescient in retrospect.Five Stars.",1,2

Good to Great,"The Challenge Built to Last, the defining management study of the nineties, showed how great companies triumph over time and how long-term sustained performance can be engineered into the DNA of an enterprise from the verybeginning. But what about the company that is not born with great DNA? How can good companies, mediocre companies, even bad companies achieve enduring greatness? The Study For years, this question preyed on the mind of Jim Collins. Are there companies that defy gravity and convert long-term mediocrity or worse into long-term superiority? And if so, what are the universal distinguishing characteristics that cause a company to go from good to great? The Standards Using tough benchmarks, Collins and his research team identified a set of elite companies that made the leap to great results and sustained those results for at least fifteen years. How great? After the leap, the good-to-great companies generated cumulative stock returns that beat the general stock market by an average of seven times in fifteen years, better than twice the results delivered by a composite index of the world's greatest companies, including Coca-Cola, Intel, General Electric, and Merck. The Comparisons The research team contrasted the good-to-great companies with a carefully selected set of comparison companies that failed to make the leap from good to great. What was different? Why did one set of companies become truly great performers while the other set remained only good? Over five years, the team analyzed the histories of all twenty-eight companies in the study. After sifting through mountains of data and thousands of pages of interviews, Collins and his crew discovered the key determinants of greatness -- why some companies make the leap and others don't. The Findings The findings of the Good to Great study will surprise many readers and shed light on virtually every area of management strategy and practice. The findings include: Level 5 Leaders: The research team was shocked to discover the type of leadership required to achieve greatness. The Hedgehog Concept (Simplicity within the Three Circles): To go from good to great requires transcending the curse of competence. A Culture of Discipline: When you combine a culture of discipline with an ethic of entrepreneurship, you get the magical alchemy of great results. Technology Accelerators: Good-to-great companies think differently about the role of technology. The Flywheel and the Doom Loop: Those who launch radical change programs and wrenching restructurings will almost certainly fail to make the leap. “Some of the key concepts discerned in the study,” comments Jim Collins, ""fly in the face of our modern business culture and will, quite frankly, upset some people.” Perhaps, but who can afford to ignore these findings?",['Jim Collins'],HarperBusiness,2001,['Business & Economics'],58.0,5.0,2010-04-16,Best business book,"This is a must read for anyone starting or growing a business or even nonprofit. In very easy to read language, Collins distills the half dozen traits that a few select companies share. What makes the book work in terms of its lessons being convincing is the empirical approach that Collins took. He didn't just choose one trait from company A and another from company B. He used an objective system to find eleven companies that by objective standards have outperformed their industries and the market as a whole and then found their common themes.",0,1

The actors all do their parts very well and overall this CD is enjoyable. It will be maddening though to Alice fans who expect the script to follow the book. I don't understand why it was thought necessary to change the plot line almost at whim and then insert ""The Walrus and the Carpenter"" (from Through the Looking Glass). What's wrong with the way Carroll wrote the book? His logic is far superior to this adaption. I felt frustrated throughout when incidents or characters were skipped, but then turned up later in the story. Surely the BBC could have done better with one of Great Britain's classics!",3,3

Under the Banner of Heaven,"NATIONAL BESTSELLER • From the author of Into the Wild and Into Thin Air, this extraordinary work of investigative journalism takes readers inside America’s isolated Mormon Fundamentalist communities. Defying both civil authorities and the Mormon establishment in Salt Lake City, the renegade leaders of these Taliban-like theocracies are zealots who answer only to God; some 40,000 people still practice polygamy in these communities. At the core of Krakauer’s book are brothers Ron and Dan Lafferty, who insist they received a commandment from God to kill a blameless woman and her baby girl. Beginning with a meticulously researched account of this appalling double murder, Krakauer constructs a multi-layered, bone-chilling narrative of messianic delusion, polygamy, savage violence, and unyielding faith. Along the way he uncovers a shadowy offshoot of America’s fastest growing religion, and raises provocative questions about the nature of religious belief.",['Jon Krakauer'],Anchor,2004,['True Crime'],35.0,5.0,2003-12-30,A Revelation!,"Krakauer has identified and documented what we former-Mormons have known and kept silent about for years (173 to be exact).

In my opinion, what Tolkien did with hobbits, dwarves, men and elves, Richard Adams has done with rabbits.At first glance, the reader may think: but what's there about rabbits that's so interesting? Of course, ""Watership down"" is not just about rabbits at all. Adams only used them as an allegory. But it's been really interesting reading about semi-sentient beings that are not distinguished by their intelligence, but by their tenacious will to survive against stronger enemies and sometimes even against themselves. More than that, Adams was able to create (like Tolkien) a spiritual, holy background for rabbits, permeating his story with nice tales about a smarter-than-most rabbit that lived in ancient times.Richard Adams tells his tale like an old-fashioned myth, like a folded piece of clothing that the reader has to unfold and never stop being amazed by its size and complexity.Grade 9.5/10",1,1

George Orwell 1984,"""Nineteen Eighty-Four: A Novel"", often published as ""1984"", is a dystopian social science fiction novel by English novelist George Orwell. It was published on 8 June 1949 by Secker & Warburg as Orwell's ninth and final book completed in his lifetime. Thematically, ""Nineteen Eighty-Four"" centres on the consequences of totalitarianism, mass surveillance, and repressive regimentation of persons and behaviours within society. Orwell, himself a democratic socialist, modelled the authoritarian government in the novel after Stalinist Russia. More broadly, the novel examines the role of truth and facts within politics and the ways in which they are manipulated. The story takes place in an imagined future, the year 1984, when much of the world has fallen victim to perpetual war, omnipresent government surveillance, historical negationism, and propaganda. Great Britain, known as Airstrip One, has become a province of a totalitarian superstate named Oceania that is ruled by the Party who employ the Thought Police to persecute individuality and independent thinking. Big Brother, the leader of the Party, enjoys an intense cult of personality despite the fact that he may not even exist. The protagonist, Winston Smith, is a diligent and skillful rank-and-file worker and Outer Party member who secretly hates the Party and dreams of rebellion. He enters into a forbidden relationship with a colleague, Julia, and starts to remember what life was like before the Party came to power.",['George Orwell'],epubli,2021,['Fiction'],562.0,4.0,1999-03-02,"1984, a disturbing realistic view of the future.","1984 pulled me in as I closed my eyes and hopes that the world would never become as corrupt as it was in Winston's world. Freedom of speech, thought, and everything and anything else that we hold dear was snatched away from the world. The Inner Party controls all and creates the stories of the past, present, and future. 2+2=5, and telescreens watch you at all times. This is what has happened on earth in George Orwell's hit, 1984. Although Orwell may not have predicted the future as it is now, it is still an exceptional book. Winston Smith's life is in constant jeopardy from the thought police and telescreens. The first mistake Winston makes is buying a journal. Then he writes in it, and the rest of the &quot;crimes&quot; come naturally. Eventually, the thought police catch him, and try to make him &quot;sane.&quot; My favorite passage is when Winston and his counselor are talking in the &quot;Ministry of Love,&quot; which is where thought criminals are taken when they are caught. His counselor says,&quot; Winston, you know, my mind is just like yours, but you're insane.&quot; They continue their talk. The story's atmosphere, as you could have guessed is overwhelming. The descriptive voice used so realistically however, moves you through Winston's mind, and where ever he goes. At times the book can be extremely slow, yet the last chapter picks up the pace, and excitement level. Bear with the book. As I just mentioned, the first two chapters of the book are not the most thrilling, but they have to be there, or the final chapter would not make sense. Mostly the book was enjoyable, and I kept saying to myself, &quot; Oh, this is what the world would be like if the Democratic Party ruled.&quot; It was exceedingly disturbing. I have to admit, the book was not my favorite, and would probably not even qualify to be on my list as on of my top five favorites. However, the description of the book filled me with emotion. Read 1984 sci-fi fan or not, I believe you'll enjoy the book. I did, despite its numerous flaws.",1,3
Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade,"A special fiftieth anniversary edition of Kurt Vonnegut’s masterpiece, “a desperate, painfully honest attempt to confront the monstrous crimes of the twentieth century” (Time), featuring a new introduction by Kevin Powers, author of the National Book Award finalist The Yellow Birds Selected by the Modern Library as one of the 100 best novels of all time Slaughterhouse-Five, an American classic, is one of the world’s great antiwar books. Centering on the infamous World War II firebombing of Dresden, the novel is the result of what Kurt Vonnegut described as a twenty-three-year struggle to write a book about what he had witnessed as an American prisoner of war. It combines historical fiction, science fiction, autobiography, and satire in an account of the life of Billy Pilgrim, a barber’s son turned draftee turned optometrist turned alien abductee. As Vonnegut had, Billy experiences the destruction of Dresden as a POW. Unlike Vonnegut, he experiences time travel, or coming “unstuck in time.” An instant bestseller, Slaughterhouse-Five made Kurt Vonnegut a cult hero in American literature, a reputation that only strengthened over time, despite his being banned and censored by some libraries and schools for content and language. But it was precisely those elements of Vonnegut’s writing—the political edginess, the genre-bending inventiveness, the frank violence, the transgressive wit—that have inspired generations of readers not just to look differently at the world around them but to find the confidence to say something about it. Authors as wide-ranging as Norman Mailer, John Irving, Michael Crichton, Tim O’Brien, Margaret Atwood, Elizabeth Strout, David Sedaris, Jennifer Egan, and J. K. Rowling have all found inspiration in Vonnegut’s words. Jonathan Safran Foer has described Vonnegut as “the kind of writer who made people—young people especially—want to write.” George Saunders has declared Vonnegut to be “the great, urgent, passionate American writer of our century, who offers us . . . a model of the kind of compassionate thinking that might yet save us from ourselves.” Fifty years after its initial publication at the height of the Vietnam War, Vonnegut's portrayal of political disillusionment, PTSD, and postwar anxiety feels as relevant, darkly humorous, and profoundly affecting as ever, an enduring beacon through our own era’s uncertainties. “Poignant and hilarious, threaded with compassion and, behind everything, the cataract of a thundering moral statement.”—The Boston Globe",['Kurt Vonnegut'],Dial Press Trade Paperback,1999,['Fiction'],1523.0,3.0,2001-04-10,Discovery Channel,"L: So, what did you think of the book? Did it go pretty smoothly for you? M: Yes, I actually finished it pretty quickly. L: I was able to read through it fast at first, but there were so many random parts that a lot of times I had to read sections twice before I understood everything. M: I thought it was kind of choppy, and a lot of the time when I finished reading a chapter, I was confused. I think one of the best words to describe the book is &quot;random.&quot; L: Sometimes I wondered if maybe Vonnegut was trying to be random on purpose, because war can be really confusing and complicated like that. Like when someone is a soldier and they are not really sure where they are and they get disoriented and they don't know why they keep fighting because they don't understand everything about why the war is going on, just like when we were reading and we didn't understand all the parts of the book and how they connected and why we continued reading. M: I never thought of it that way, Laura! Interesting analogy. An example of the randomosity from chapter six: &quot;And Billy worked his hands in his muff as he marched. His fingertips, working there in the hot darkness of the muff, wanted to know what the two lumps in the lining of the little impresario's were. The fingertips got inside the lining. They palpated the lumps, the pea-shaped thing and the horseshoe-shaped thing. The parade had to halt by a busy corner. The traffic light was red. M: I totally remember that quote from the book because I kept laughing at the work &quot;muff.&quot; And I kept thinking to myself, &quot;What does this have to do with the story?&quot; What do you think about the quote, Laura? L: There were definetely many instances when paragraphs seemed to just come out of the blue. Sometimes there were important issues that I thought about because of different things that happened in the book, but a lot of the time I was just bewildered. M: I thought the book had some interesting ideas about war, since it is an anti-war book. Like, war is unstoppable. I liked how Vonnegut compared it to a glacier-there's no use trying to get rid of it, because it will always be there, no matter what. L: So it goes M: Ha ha, that's a good one. L: Vonnegut writes &quot;So it goes&quot; whenever death is mentioned in the book, which is very often. Usually it comes up after a human dies, but a few times it came up about other things, like plants, or book reviews. Do you think everything in the world is sort of alive? M: Sure, I think things are alive, but I'm not sure if they have feelings like humans do. They might to a certain extent, but I don't think a plant feels the same way I do! L: Let's start talking about the aliens M: This is a topic I really like. Those little green creatures crack me up. L: They sure did do a lot of crazy stuff! One of my favorites parts is when the Tralfamadorians explain how it takes something like 7 genders to make a baby. M: Or what about the part when Billy and Montana were getting it on, and the aliens watched like it was some kind of entertainment, and they (the aliens) treated them (billy and Montana) like they were some kind of animals being observed in a zoo, and it's weird to think how we watch animals in a zoo, and the aliens watched humans in their own &quot;zoo-like&quot; environment. It brought to mind a line from a popular song-You and me baby ain't nothing but mammals so let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel L: Yeah! I bet if we watched ourselves (humans) from a distance, we would see a lot of pretty weird stuff occurrring. Sometimes we act strange, and do things that don't really make sense...just like Vonnegut doesn't always seem to make sense! M: Would you recommend this book to a friend, Laura? L: Hmm...I think it's a really important book, and it's a classic and stuff. It made me think a lot and I'm glad I've read it. I guess I would tell people they should read it when they are ready, and if they get a little confused, that's okay. M: So it goes L: Our review is dead now.",4,12
Marine sniper: 93 confirmed kills,"Profiles Marine Carlos Hathcock, an ace marksman, whose missions during the Vietnam War included assassinating a North Vietnamese.",['Charles Henderson'],Penguin,2001,['Biography & Autobiography'],19.0,5.0,1999-05-26,The Marine Corps doesn't mess around.,"This book is the story of GunnerySergeant Carlos Hathcock, USMC.What is so remarkable about this individual is the fact that he holds the highest number of confirmed kills in Vietnam by USMC Scout/ Snipers. This man also made the longest known shot with a kill at 2500 yards. This book is about this gentleman's life. Hathcock graduated high school in 1964 and entered the Marine Corps in that year. Before he was shipped to Vietnam, Hathcock won all kinds of matches with the Marine Corps marksmanship Unit. Hathcock earned his Navy Cross by returning six times to a damaged and burning armored personnel carrier to save the unconscious Marines within. He did this after being burned and blown up by the artillery shell that hit the APC. After he left the Marine Corps, Hathcock became a firearms instructor for the FBI and many smaller state agencies. He was diagnosed with MS and in February of this year died from complications at the age of 57. This is particularly poignant to me because I had the privilege of meeting this fine man twice in my life. Many people consider him a murderer, but I do not. He was simply the kind of extraordinary soldier that armies have relied upon for centuries. Carlos Hathcock is the type of role model people of today should look up to instead of individuals such as bill clinton.",3,6
The Northern Crusades: Second Edition,"Inspired by the Pope's call for a Holy War, Scandinavian rulers and German military monks conquered and settled Finland, Estonia and Prussia, before turning on the eastern empires of Orthodox Novgorod and pagan Lithuania. These 'Northern Crusades' are less celebrated than those in the Middle East, but they were also far more successful. Vast new territories became and remain Christian, while the central institutions of medieval Western Europe - churches, castles, manors, guilds, parliaments and feudal law codes - were introduced into a dark and inhospitable outer world. Now newly revised in the light of the recent developments in Baltic and Northern medieval research, this overview provides a balanced and compelling account of a tumultuous era.",['Eric Christiansen'],Penguin Books,1997,['History'],4.0,5.0,1999-01-29,One of the best history books.,"A fascinating, well written account of the north-eastern part of European history that is often missing in most books.While this is a book filled with historic facts and dates, it is written in such a manner that it is easy for even the non student to read and understand.Once started, the book was hard to put down. It answered so many questions of who, why and how the current nationalites emerged. So much was revealed about the people and cultures of the area.This book should be required reading in high schools and colleges. A must for anyone who loves history.",9,9
To kill a mockingbird,"Voted America's Best-Loved Novel in PBS's The Great American Read Harper Lee's Pulitzer Prize-winning masterwork of honor and injustice in the deep South—and the heroism of one man in the face of blind and violent hatred One of the most cherished stories of all time, To Kill a Mockingbird has been translated into more than forty languages, sold more than forty million copies worldwide, served as the basis for an enormously popular motion picture, and was voted one of the best novels of the twentieth century by librarians across the country. A gripping, heart-wrenching, and wholly remarkable tale of coming-of-age in a South poisoned by virulent prejudice, it views a world of great beauty and savage inequities through the eyes of a young girl, as her father—a crusading local lawyer—risks everything to defend a black man unjustly accused of a terrible crime.",['Harper Lee'],Harper Collins,2014,['Fiction'],2164.0,4.0,2010-12-05,"Great book, Not my style.","An eighth grader like myself doesn't take much interest in classic literature like TKAM.

Hannibal,"#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • “Is it as good as Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs? No . . . this one is better.”—Stephen King, The New York Times Book Review You remember Hannibal Lecter: gentleman, genius, cannibal. Seven years have passed since Dr. Lecter escaped from custody. And for seven years he’s been at large, free to savor the scents, the essences, of an unguarded world. But intruders have entered Dr. Lecter’s world, piercing his new identity, sensing the evil that surrounds him. For the multimillionaire Hannibal left maimed, for a corrupt Italian policeman, and for FBI agent Clarice Starling, who once stood before Lecter and who has never been the same, the final hunt for Hannibal Lecter has begun. All of them, in their separate ways, want to find Dr. Lecter. And all three will get their wish. But only one will live long enough to savor the reward. . . . Praise for Hannibal “Interested in getting the hell scared out of you? Buy this book on a Friday . . . lock all doors and windows. And by Monday , you might just be able to sleep without a night-light.”—Newsday “Strap yourself in for one heck of a ride. . . . It’ll scare your socks off.”—Denver Post “A stunner . . . writing in language as bright and precise as a surgeon’s scalpel, Harris has created a world as mysterious as Hannibal’s memory palace and as disturbing as a Goya painting. This is one book you don’t want to read alone at night.”—The Atlanta Journal-Constitution “Relentless . . . endlessly terrifying . . . 486 fast-paced pages, in which every respite is but a prelude to further furious action . . . Hannibal begins with a murderous paroxysm that leaves the reader breathless. . . . Hannibal speaks to the imagination, to the feelings, to the passions, to exalted senses and to debased ones. Harris’s voice will be heard for a while.”—Los Angeles Times “A pleasurable sense of dread.”—The Wall Street Journal “Enormously satisfying . . . a smashing good time, turning the pages for thrills, chills, horror and finally, a bracing, deliciously wicked slap in the face . . . perhaps the very best the thriller/horror genre is capable of producing.”—San Diego Union-Tribune",['Thomas Harris'],Dell,2009,['Fiction'],41.0,3.0,1999-10-15,Love it or Hate it you will never forget it.,"I must admit that after the almost 13 year wait between Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal (Silence of the Lambs was published in 1986 remember?) I was greatly anticipating the sequel.I have read almost all the reviews associtated with this book and while I feel that there were some major problems with character developement and plot, I must admit that I was not all that dissapointed. Why some of you may ask? Well for one reason, I knew Mr. Harris was going to hard pressed to top Silence of the Lambs, which in my opinion was one of the best written thrillers of the past 30 years, and number two the film adapation of the book did win an Oscar. I know that has little to do with how good the book is, but when the film wins an Oscar us readers do tend to expect more out of any sequel be it book or movie.Mr. Harris did spend alot of time revealing the motivations behind Lecter's sadistic tendencies, and while it did tend to remove some of the mystique from the character I feel this is something that he did need to do. Lecter was written as a flesh and blood human being remember? And there is always something that makes a human being turn bad (and no I am not going to get into a debate over nature versus nuture here). I had a hard time believing that Lecter was evil just for the sake of being evil, which is how is was protrayed in the first two books, and in this book Harris does paint a rather convincing picture of what exactly it was that made Lecter turn against society and become a monster.My main problem with this book was the Clarice Starling character, in the Silence of the Lambs, she was portrayed as a strong, resourceful and inituitive woman a worthy heir to Will Graham the hero of Harris' first book Red Dragon, in this book however she is reduced to less than that, now I know that seven years in any govenment agency (esp. the FBI) is enough to suck the life out of anyone, but I had a hard time believing that Clarice would let that happen to herself. By the end of the book I was looking for her to be the good balancing out all of the evil that permeated the novel, and of course it turns out she wasn't. We tend to like our heroes in fiction clear cut and honest and with this novel I can honestly say that did not happen.The book tended to read more like a morality play than a thriller and that is not really why I read Mr. Harris' previous books.While I did have a problem with the way the characters where protrayed in the book, I do think it was very well written and did move along at a relatively nice pace, which is all I really ask for in a Thomas Harris novel.",0,0
"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","""Fascinating.... Lays a foundation for understanding human history.""—Bill Gates In this ""artful, informative, and delightful"" (William H. McNeill, New York Review of Books) book, Jared Diamond convincingly argues that geographical and environmental factors shaped the modern world. Societies that had had a head start in food production advanced beyond the hunter-gatherer stage, and then developed religion --as well as nasty germs and potent weapons of war --and adventured on sea and land to conquer and decimate preliterate cultures. A major advance in our understanding of human societies, Guns, Germs, and Steel chronicles the way that the modern world came to be and stunningly dismantles racially based theories of human history. Winner of the Pulitzer Prize, the Phi Beta Kappa Award in Science, the Rhone-Poulenc Prize, and the Commonwealth club of California's Gold Medal.",['Jared Diamond'],W. W. Norton & Company,2017,['History'],31.0,2.0,2001-08-21,"Review of Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs and Steel: The Fates o","The author's intent in writing Guns, Germs, and Steel is to explain how the different peoples of the world came to be the way they are. His intent is to prove his own belief that the reason mankind is the way it is because of its geography. By geography it means that different geographical areas with varying climates and natural resources directly influenced the path that mankind took in becoming the way it is today. It is, in a way, an attempt to explain human history in a way that it could have been predicted. However, it is arrogant to think that it was man's destiny to be this way. It is arrogant to think that the Spaniards were meant to conquer the Inca's and Aztec's and not have the Inca's conquer them. Luckily, the author points this out and makes it his intent to discover why it is not the other way around. If the events that are told are factual, he came upon the idea of explaining human history when a politician from New Guinea named asked him why the white man discovered such technological wonders instead of, say, a New Guinea highlander. The author realizes that most answers given would seem racist and sets out to discover why. Basically, he intends to answer Yali's question. He intends to look at human history as a science. He intends to only make assumptions based on scientific evidence and on a basis of solid genetics and logic. He intends to write a book to end all history books. He intends to give an argument so solid, so carefully planned, that no one could possibly argue with it. He intends to think of every possibility and examine every one of them to finalize its validity. In short, he intends to write a history of man that explains how we became the technology driven, world controlling, diverse peoples that we are. The author goes about explaining humanity by carefully examining every theory as to why different cultures in different regions evolved so differently from each other. Naturally the first thing he disproves is that there is a difference genetically in the peoples themselves. His discoveries prove quite contrary to the racist beliefs of the past. Modern medicine has taken the ""civilized"" world out of natural selection. However, the ""uncivilized"" portion of the world is still very much at nature's whim. Natural selection certainly doesn't favor the stupid or weak, so genetically the ""uncivilized"" are probably far superior to the ""civilized"". Analysis based on logic such as this takes up most of the book. Eventually the author settles that the turning point in deciding uncivilized versus civilized for a society is when that society adopted agriculture and a sedentary lifestyle. He deduces that a sedentary, agricultural lifestyle encouraged technological advancements and allowed for population growth and expansion. A certain amount of land can support more agricultural people then hunter-gatherer people. Through sheer numbers agriculture and therefore ""civilization"" spread across the world. Naturally the areas to discover agriculture first became more advanced quicker. Therefore natural resources played a big role. However, for this to be accepted as fact one must first analyze why agriculture arose in some areas and not others, how plants are domesticated and so on and so forth. Every explanation leads to ten more needed explanations which leads to 100 more explanations which continues for a couple hundred pages. Everything is thought of and no detail or factor of human history is left out, right down to how plants were probably domesticated through surprises found in excretions, the main way plants go about spreading from place to place. The details are accompanied by numerous graphs, tables, maps and pictures, which either repeat the details or explain them even more. The author goes about his task so meticulously and carefully that the details begin to bog everything down. Where the author is going with the information or why he is explaining so many details is often never explained. Some details seem unnecessary and irrelevant. Whatever point the author is trying to make is often lost in the details. The author goes about his task of explaining humanity by analyzing events in history and going into great detail as to how we came to be the way we are. However, the way it feels is that the author wants to bore the reader into submission in believing his view. The book is successful in what it was trying to accomplish, in that it logically explains how humanity came to be the way it is. However, it is not successful in being at all enjoyable. I felt as though I was being bombarded with facts and smothered with useless information. I suppose I was persuaded to believe that geography and its contributing factors lead to humanity being the way it is, but does it really matter? Were the hours I spent reading this book at all necessary? Was this book necessary? This book leaves me with questions like that. This book leaves me unsatisfied. Not once did it even try to answer or even pose the question as to whether civilized or uncivilized life is better. Not once does it attempt to tackle whether civilized life is more worthwhile or enjoyable or more rewarding. It seems to only answer questions that it can answer and avoid all that it can't. It seems afraid to try to answer questions of a more philosophical nature. The book concentrates so much on being only facts that it bored me to death. It hides from speaking opinions so much that it also hides from being even remotely interesting. Opinions may at times be controversial, but they are never boring. How this book won the Pulitzer Prize I do not know. This book was a boring collection of facts and logic. I would advise the reader of this review to ignore this book completely. Don't read this book unless you are in desperate need of a long nap.",3,11

Some of the dialouge is so clever and hilarious that you just can't help but be impressed. I actually prefer books like this, where the marriage itself happens earlier on, leaving other things for the plot to center on. This book did a fairly good job with the mystery, but it's a romance first and foremost. Roddy is a great heroine - I never got sick of her or spent the book thinking how stupid she was, as I do with most romance heroines.

Pride and Prejudice,"In early nineteenth-century England, a spirited young woman copes with the suit of a snobbish gentleman, as well as the romantic entanglements of her four sisters.",['Jane Austen'],Courier Corporation,1995,['Fiction'],7.0,5.0,2002-09-26,A Lovely Edition of a Classic Novel!,"Someone once said that a classic work of literature is one which everyone loves to be able to acknowledge having read but which no one actually enjoys reading. To be fair, there is some justification in this sentiment, as many classic novels are not readily accessable to readers not versed in various literary devices, symbolism, and so on. Fortunately, Pride and Prejudice does NOT fall into that category. It is a novel which has an interesting, captivating story that is easily accessible and humorous yet intelligent, insightful and extremely witty--in short, it's a novel which is a joy to read and re-read. It is also my favourite Austen novel.Briefly, for those unfamiliar with the novel, the story concerns Miss Elizabeth Bennet, a spirited, quick-witted and intelligent (not to mention beautiful) young woman from a family of modest means, and the wealthy Mr. Darcy, a handsome but very reserved and indeed proud young man. Darcy falls in love with Elizabeth albeit against his will (for he deems her to be socially inferior and cannot abide her silly mother and sisters). Elizabeth (who displays a quickness to judge others based on appearances and ""first impressions""), however, does not care for the arrogant, proud, ill-mannered Mr. Darcy. It is the tension between these two main characters that comprises the central story and gives it its spark. I won't say any more, for I don't wish to give the story away. Suffice it to say that although it takes place some 200 years ago, it is every bit as relevant today as it was then, for human nature is no different now than it ever was.Now to address the merits of this particular edition. (As reviews unfortunately are posted next to all editions, regardless of the one to which they may apply, the edition to which I refer is the hardcover Modern Library edition with the picture of Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle on the cover). Generally, when one is looking to purchase a hardcover of one of the classics it is because one is looking for an edition that will be a more permanent addition to his or her library--one that looks nice and that can, perhaps, be passed on to future generations. Personally, my first choice for hardcovers of the classics are those published by the Folio Society. Having said that, this edition has a lot to recommend it. Most importantly, it is printed on acid-free paper, so it will last without the pages turning brown (unlike those nice-looking but disappointingly cheap-quality bargain hardcovers one usually finds on the sale table in one's local bookstore).Secondly, the print is beautifully crisp and clear. The print is not as large as one might hope for in a hardcover, but it is a vast improvement over the cheap ""mass market"" type paperbacks. Actually, I was surprised to find that it's only minimally smaller than my Easton Press edition, although the lines are further apart in the latter edition (which does make a bit of a difference).As if that's not enough to recommend this edition, it has the added benefit of being housed in a very attractive dust jacket which looks beautiful alongside the BBC/A&E; video collection--the definitive dramatisation of the novel and definitely a must-see. (This edition was initially released as a companion to the video collection).In conclusion, I give 5 stars for the story, and I have no hesitation in giving 5 stars for the Modern Library edition of the novel--it's a lovely edition. Considering the quality, it is very well priced--definitely good value for one's money. And for those who've steered clear of the classics for fear that they must necessarily be dull and incomprehensible, give this novel a try--I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. Highly recommended!",4,5
Already Dead (A Joe Pitt Novel),"Those stories you hear? The ones about things that only come out at night? Things that feed on blood, feed on us? Got news for you: they’re true. Only it’s not like the movies or old man Stoker’s storybook. It’s worse. Especially if you happen to be one of them. Just ask Joe Pitt. There’s a shambler on the loose. Some fool who got himself infected with a flesh-eating bacteria is lurching around, trying to munch on folks’ brains. Joe hates shamblers, but he’s still the one who has to deal with them. That’s just the kind of life he has. Except afterlife might be better word. From the Battery to the Bronx, and from river to river, Manhattan is crawling with Vampyres. Joe is one of them, and he’s not happy about it. Yeah, he gets to be stronger and faster than you, and he’s tough as nails and hard to kill. But spending his nights trying to score a pint of blood to feed the Vyrus that’s eating at him isn’t his idea of a good time. And Joe doesn’t make it any easier on himself. Going his own way, refusing to ally with the Clans that run the undead underside of Manhattan–it ain’t easy. It’s worse once he gets mixed up with the Coalition–the city’s most powerful Clan–and finds himself searching for a poor little rich girl who’s gone missing in Alphabet City. Now the Coalition and the girl’s high-society parents are breathing down his neck, anarchist Vampyres are pushing him around, and a crazy Vampyre cult is stalking him. No time to complain, though.

I bought them right then and there. I read all five in sequence (which is really necessary if you are going to read them all) without a break for other books. I couldn't stop and when I was done I wanted more.I'm a fan of both the hard-case detective novels such as Raymond Chandler and Joe Gores, and vampire books set in the modern era. The Joe Pit series is sort of a combination Vampire/Film Noir type book where the protagonist is of the Phillip Marlowe ilk only his drinking problem is due to a more reddish colored liqueur. This is not a teen vampire book with a bunch of swishy bloodsuckers, these are bad-ass moofoos you do not want to meet at a singles bar. At least not when they are thirsty.The dialog is realistic but Mr Huston's style of using leading dashes instead of leading and closing quotes take some getting used to, and occasionally it is confusing as to when the quote ends and the narration continues.Each one of the books stands on its own, but the series itself has several threads running through it that are dependent upon the books being read in sequence. So read the first one (it is free for the Kindle as of this writing), then be prepared to fork out for the remaining four as they are addictive.

When I'm reading a novel about a dysfunctional family I want to read about THEM and what makes them tick, not a load of rubbish about catfish or something like that. Essentially the story is about the relationship with Sidda and Vivi and I think that Wells should have concentrated on that instead of giving a voice to so many other characters. Also having read the prequel I understand even less the fuss about the YaYas in Divine Secrets - about their unique style/friendship etc. In this book they come across as a bunch of rather vulgar women who spend their entire time getting drunk.

Throughout the novel, family relations, economical issues, humiliation of making a mistake, and falling in love are thoroughly described amongst all of the characters. Three of the five sisters marry in the book while encountering pride and prejudice of position or status. The eldest daughter of the Bennetts, Jane, falls in love and marries a man named Charles Bingley. She is the second of the three daughters that marry during the story because of a delay caused by Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy who had initially made Bingley think Jane does not love him because of her poor economical status and family relations. However, it is also Darcy who later convinces Bingley to finally marry Jane out of his own love for Janeas younger sister Elizabeth. After both Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth overcome their pride and prejudice against each other, they are also married. Elizabeth is the third daughter to marry. The first daughter to marry is Lydia, who foolishly elopes with the untrustworthy George Wickham whose primary intention was not to marry her, but who eventually agrees to the marriage on terms agreed to by Darcy and Bingley. The novel describes the pride and prejudice that all of the characters manage to overcome in order to live contentedly.Although the language used in Pride and Prejudice was difficult for a fourteen year-old, as I kept reading it became clearer and easier to understand the 19th century speech. The womenaes rights that Austen presented were beyond her time and I developed great respect for her. The message about overcoming pride and prejudice and marrying not for money but for love was very powerful and I felt that it was appropriate to be read for a humanities class because it was closely related to the topics we have been going over in class. Overall, I thought that Pride and Prejudice was a very well written and entertaining novel.",2,3

His quick mastery of quantum mechanics earned him a place at Los Alamos working on the Manhattan Project under J. Robert Oppenheimer, where the giddy young man held his own among the nation’s greatest minds. There, Feynman turned theory into practice, culminating in the Trinity test, on July 16, 1945, when the Atomic Age was born. He was only twenty-seven. And he was just getting started. In this sweeping biography, James Gleick captures the forceful personality of a great man, integrating Feynman’s work and life in a way that is accessible to laymen and fascinating for the scientists who follow in his footsteps.",['James Gleick'],Open Road Media,2011,['Biography & Autobiography'],18.0,2.0,2012-12-25,VERY DRY -- from an Engineering Major,"I wanted to learn more about quantum mechanics and a friend recommended this book to me...Unfortunately, I found this book incredibly DRY and BORING! This book seemed to just be a series of mathematical/physics problems (complete with diagrams). The science was too detailed for the average reader and probably too basic for physicists/mathematicians. So, not sure who the author was targeting as an audience. I was an engineering major who loved calculus and physics as an undergraduate. Yet, I found I had to skip around the book after the first 100 pages because the prose just didn't hold my attention.Sprinkled between Feynman's scientific projects were anecdotes about his early years, first wife, Arline, his strained relationship with his mother, and his subsequent and notorious womanizing. Yet, their place in the storyline is so disjointed that I never got a sense of Feynman the man...just Feynman the reputed whiz-kid whose life seemed solely comprised of his scientific work to the extent that he is socially awkward, uninterested - and essentially illiterate - in the literature, the arts or anything outside science. Either he was an incredibly uni-dimensional person or the author does him a big disservice and makes him seem so.In comparison, the stellar biography of Einstein by Walter Isaacson does a great job of humanizing the last century's most iconic scientist. He also creates a nice balance of discussing enough scientific theory to make one appreciate the importance of Einstein's work but told in a way that is understandable and interesting to the general public. Unfortunately, despite Gleick's apparent admiration for his subject, Richard Feynman, his biography does not bring Feynman to life. There is definitely room for a better, more fluid biography on this great scientist - regardless of the prizes the book may have garnered when it first came out in 1993.BTW, I ended up going to Youtube and Wikipedia to find out more on Feynman and Quantum Mechanics. To see a lecture he gave on Quantum Mechanics (and see how lively a speaker he was), check out: [...]",0,1

Dry wit all the way through - I spent some time in Somerset last time I was in the UK so I could appreciate village life (it doesn't differ that much from here in Australia!) and what happens to the protagonists.Very good read, clever and funny :) RecommendedDiana Hockley",0,0
Howards End,"The Never-Ending Conflict Between the Old Ways and the New Ways “The tragedy of preparedness has scarcely been handled, save by the Greeks. Life is indeed dangerous, but not in the way morality would have us believe. It is indeed unmanageable, but the essence of it is not a battle. It is unmanageable because it is a romance, and its essence is romantic beauty.” - E.M. Forster, Howards End Howards End is an estate with a rich history and cultural heritage cherished by the Wilcoxes, a rich family with traditional ideas. However, the half-German Schlegeles – the new aristocracy – are not that impressed, yet Ruth Wilcox sees Margaret Schlegel as the ideal owner. That’s why on deathbed, Ruth leaves the house to Margaret in written note. The note is burnt by the husband Henry who grows fonder of Margaret with each passing day. Is Margaret bound to Howards End?

We have the eldest, governing in the family and also carrying the burden of her unshared knowledge -derived from a mixture of wisdom, fairness and compassion-; and we have the youngest, whose actions are ruled by impulse and who therefore is wrong although she means well. There is also symbolism, so dear to the modernist fiction, which doesn`t prevent the author from building round, absolute characters that sound like real life. I was very amused by E.M.Foster's worry with globalization -which he calls &quot;cosmopolitanism&quot;- as a tendency opposed to those who want to keep England as close to its origins as possible -i.e. the author himself; actually, the whole novel and its symbolism revolve around this worry.In short, the two sisters sound very much like those in Sense and Sensibility, but E.M.Foster's intention is more intellectual, less social or ethical than that of Jane Austen's",1,2

Harvest,"SHORT-LISTED FOR THE MAN BOOKER PRIZE A Christian Science Monitor Best Book of the Year On the morning after harvest, the inhabitants of a remote English village awaken looking forward to a hard-earned day of rest and feasting at their landowner's table. But the sky is marred by two conspicuous columns of smoke, replacing pleasurable anticipation with alarm and suspicion. One smoke column is the result of an overnight fire that has damaged the master's outbuildings. The second column rises from the wooded edge of the village, sent up by newcomers to announce their presence. In the minds of the wary villagers a mere coincidence of events appears to be unlikely, with violent confrontation looming as the unavoidable outcome. Meanwhile, another newcomer has recently been spotted taking careful notes and making drawings of the land. It is his presence more than any other that will threaten the village's entire way of life.

The Death of Common Sense: How Law is Suffocating America,"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER “We need a new idea of how to govern. The current system is broken. Law is supposed to be a framework for humans to make choices, not the replacement for free choice.” So notes Philip K. Howard in the new Afterword to his explosive manifesto The Death of Common Sense. Here Howard offers nothing less than a fresh, lucid, practical operating system for modern democracy. America is drowning—in law, lawsuits, and nearly endless red tape. Before acting or making a decision, we often abandon our best instincts. We pause, we worry, we equivocate, and then we divert our energy into trying to protect ourselves.

The Man Who Loved Children,"“This crazy, gorgeous family novel” written at the end of the Great Depression “is one of the great literary achievements of the twentieth century” (Jonathan Franzen, The New York Times). First published in 1940, The Man Who Loved Children was rediscovered in 1965 thanks to the poet Randall Jarrell’s eloquent introduction (included in this ebook edition), which compares Christina Stead to Leo Tolstoy. Today, it stands as a masterpiece of dysfunctional family life. In a country crippled by the Great Depression, Sam and Henny Pollit have too much—too much contempt for one another, too many children, too much strain under endless obligation. Flush with ego and chilling charisma, Sam torments and manipulates his children in an esoteric world of his own imagining. Henny looks on desperately, all too aware of the madness at the root of her husband’s behavior. And Louie, the damaged, precocious adolescent girl at the center of their clashes, is the “ugly duckling” whose struggle will transfix contemporary readers. Named one of the best novels of the twentieth century by Newsweek, Stead’s semiautobiographical work reads like a Depression-era The Glass Castle. In the New York Times, Jonathan Franzen wrote of this classic, “I carry it in my head the way I carry childhood memories; the scenes are of such precise horror and comedy that I feel I didn’t read the book so much as live it.”",['Christina Stead'],Open Road Media,2012,['Fiction'],13.0,5.0,2010-09-23,"Thank you, Jonathan Franzen","I read 30-40 novels a year and will say roundly that ""The Man"" is deeply satisfying. Most novels fail to resolve the complications they create, and this includes the ones that I very much enjoy for other reasons such as the author's digressions. This novel does not have intellectual additions or asides: it has one consistent theme which leads to a great resolution. Nothing interferes with the story's advance, but there are sections that could have been shortened. By contemporary standards it is a long novel which could have been made tighter with the omission of 50-100 pages. I award 5 stars because it is entertaining and cathartic. It reads quickly so the 500 pages are no problem. Don't read the introduction until after reading the novel as knowing the ending ahead of time never increases interest in a story.",8,8

Their mission: to split an atom and end a war. But among those who have come to Robert Oppenheimer ’s “enchanted campus” of foreign-born scientists, baffled guards, and restless wives is a simple man in search of a killer.

The only link-both victims belonged to the Mormon Church. The next day, a third bomb was detonated in the parked car of church-going family man, Mark Hoffman. Incredibly, he survived. It wasn't until authorities questioned the strangely evasive Hoffman that another, more shocking link between the victims emerged... It was the appearance of an alleged historic document that challenged the very bedrock of Mormon teaching, questioned the legitimacy of its founder, and threatened to disillusion millions of its faithful-unless the Mormon hierarchy buried the evidence.","['Steven Naifeh', 'Gregory White Smith']",St. Martin's Paperbacks,2015,['True Crime'],1.0,3.0,2004-04-12,A vicious attack on Mormonism,"At first sight, this appears to be an engrossing true-crime narrative. But it soon becomes evident that the real agenda of the authors is to use the crime case as an excuse for attacking the Mormon church. All of the Mormon leaders are presented as scoundrels and all of the followers are presented as fools. In short, Mormonism is demonized. The book is full of cheap shots. No stone is left unturned in the authors' quest to ridicule Mormonism. This is out of place in a true-crime book and hopelessly detracts and distracts from the narrative. We are expected to believe that two-thirds of the inhabitants of an American state are scoundrels and fools. Nonsense!",12,35

About Half,"""An audacious and concrete proposal…Half-Earth completes the 86-year-old Wilson’s valedictory trilogy on the human animal and our place on the planet."" —Jedediah Purdy, New Republic In his most urgent book to date, Pulitzer Prize–winning author and world-renowned biologist Edward O. Wilson states that in order to stave off the mass extinction of species, including our own, we must move swiftly to preserve the biodiversity of our planet. In this ""visionary blueprint for saving the planet"" (Stephen Greenblatt), Half-Earth argues that the situation facing us is too large to be solved piecemeal and proposes a solution commensurate with the magnitude of the problem: dedicate fully half the surface of the Earth to nature. Identifying actual regions of the planet that can still be reclaimed—such as the California redwood forest, the Amazon River basin, and grasslands of the Serengeti, among others—Wilson puts aside the prevailing pessimism of our times and ""speaks with a humane eloquence which calls to us all"" (Oliver Sacks).",['Edward O.

Enchantment,"In Enchantment, Orson Scott Card works his magic as never before, transforming the timeless story of Sleeping Beauty into an original fantasy brimming with romance and adventure. The moment Ivan stumbled upon a clearing in the dense Carpathian forest, his life was forever changed. Atop a pedestal encircled by fallen leaves, the beautiful princess Katerina lay still as death. But beneath the foliage a malevolent presence stirred and sent the ten-year-old Ivan scrambling for the safety of Cousin Marek's farm. Now, years later, Ivan is an American graduate student, engaged to be married. Yet he cannot forget that long-ago day in the forest—or convince himself it was merely a frightened boy’s fantasy. Compelled to return to his native land, Ivan finds the clearing just as he left it. This time he does not run. This time he awakens the beauty with a kiss . . . and steps into a world that vanished a thousand years ago.

4 Blondes,"The New York Times bestseller that “chronicles the glittering lives of semicelebrities, social aspirants, and moneyed folk [with] withering precision” (The New York Times). From the author of Sex and the City, this collection of novellas tells the stories of four women facing up to the limitations of their rapidly approaching middle age in an era that worships youth. From the former it-girl heroine of “Nice N’Easy,” who each summer looks for a rich man who’ll provide her with a house in the Hamptons, to the narrator of “Single Process,” who goes to London on a hunt for love and a good magazine story, Candace Bushnell brings to life contemporary women in search of something more—when the world is pushing for them to settle for less.

The Given Day,"""Gut-wrenching force...A majestic, fiery epic. The Given Day is a huge, impassioned, intensively researched book that brings history alive."" - The New York Times Dennis Lehane, the New York Times bestselling author of Live by Night—now a Warner Bros. movie starring Ben Affleck—offers an unflinching family epic that captures the political unrest of a nation caught between a well-patterned past and an unpredictable future. This beautifully written novel of American history tells the story of two families—one black, one white—swept up in a maelstrom of revolutionaries and anarchists, immigrants and ward bosses, Brahmins and ordinary citizens, all engaged in a battle for survival and power at the end of World War I.",['Dennis Lehane'],Harper Collins,2009,['Fiction'],94.0,5.0,2008-11-09,Write-Well.net Book Review: The Given Day,"From BenPfeiffer[...]:This year in Anaheim at the American Library Association (ALA) convention, among several worthy titles, I picked up a copy of The Given Day by Dennis Lehane.The book comes out on September 23rd, 2008. At the bottom of the cover, the inscription ""New York Times bestselling author of mystic river"" caught my eye.The front flap--rather than reveal the story's details--was a short letter from Jane Friedman at WilliamMorrow.""In The Given Day we discover a new Dennis--one who has crafted a literary tour de force,"" Friedman wrote. ""Brilliantly written, expertly plotted, rich with historical detail and sense of place, this is a book whose themes continue to resonate.""At the time, I admit to wondering if any book could live up to that hype. I opened the covers and turned to the prologue: ""Babe Ruth in Ohio.""Ten days later, when I had finished the galley--the book was impossible to put down--I was a believer. Dennis Lehane had written something amazing. When I asked him about the novel as part of my Ask the Writer series, he brushed aside the question with a joke.""I would strongly recommend nobody ever attempt a historical epic,"" Lehane says. ""It's for crazy people. Way too much hard work. I'm glad it's done. I hope it's good.""In fact, the book is good. Very, very good.Set in Boston at the end of the 1917, The Given Day brings to life a forgotten era in American history. Woodrow Wilson is the president of the United States. Calvin Coolidge is the governor of Massachusetts. The narrative follows two families: one white, one black. This is a time when one world is dying and another world is not yet born; a time of revolutions, terrorism, plagues, reds, anarchists, fear, and social upheaval. To even a casual reader, the parallels to our own time may be familiar. With good reason, Lehane says, although he can't take all the credit.""The parallels reared their head very early,"" Lehane says. ""I had no hand in that; the gods wrapped me a gift. All I had to do was put it to paper; editorializing or commenting on the parallels in any fashion would have been redundant. History proves that, time and time again, fear or the perception of powerlessness produces fascist impulses in people and societies. The more afraid you are, the more vicious and infantile you usually become. I don't think I say anything revolutionary in that regard with The Given Day, but that doesn't mean it shouldn't be said and said as much as possible.""Social commentary aside, The Given Day is a terrific story--historical fiction at its finest. Dennis Lehane keeps the pace moving fast enough to satisfy a restless mind and slow enough to explore hidden agendas and emotions in each person he creates (or resurrects). With so much research, detail, and historical fact, Lehane never once falls into the trap of becoming professorial. Even in today's fast-paced society, The Given Day will hold its own among films, blogs, and television as a work of entertainment. The writing in The Given Day is artistic without sacrificing function. Lehane keeps tight control over his sprawling epic, treating each character with the proper respect and distance. It's been a long time since I read a novel so well written. I can't go on at length without revealing too much of the plot or the characters--so I won't. This is a book you should pick up and read for yourself.",2,4

Apparently Margaret Fishback Powers decided to become an evangalist only 25 years ago, this poem was written in 1963 by a different author whose work reflects it's anonymous authorship at the U.S. Copyright Office. What bothers me most about this book is Margaret only quotes scripture, she never authors poetry. Think about that people, doesn't a poet write poetry! Margaret does not author poetry, therefore in my opinion I think she is only interested in taking claim to someelses work, namely mine.

Lucky Man: A Memoir,"A funny, highly personal, gorgeously written account of what it's like to be a 30-year-old man who is told he has an 80-year-old's disease. ""Life is great. Sometimes, though, you just have to put up with a little more crap."" --Michael J. Fox In September 1998, Michael J. Fox stunned the world by announcing he had been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease--a degenerative neurological condition. In fact, he had been secretly fighting it for seven years. The worldwide response was staggering. Fortunately, he had accepted the diagnosis and by the time the public started grieving for him, he had stopped grieving for himself. Now, with the same passion, humor, and energy that Fox has invested in his dozens of performances over the last 18 years, he tells the story of his life, his career, and his campaign to find a cure for Parkinson's. Combining his trademark ironic sensibility and keen sense of the absurd, he recounts his life--from his childhood in a small town in western Canada to his meteoric rise in film and television which made him a worldwide celebrity. Most importantly however, he writes of the last 10 years, during which--with the unswerving support of his wife, family, and friends--he has dealt with his illness. He talks about what Parkinson's has given him: the chance to appreciate a wonderful life and career, and the opportunity to help search for a cure and spread public awareness of the disease. He is a very lucky man, indeed. The Michael J. Fox Foundation Michael J. Fox is donating the profits from his book to the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research, which is dedicated to fast-forwarding the cure for Parkinson's disease. The Foundation will move aggressively to identify the most promising research and raise the funds to assure that a cure is found for the millions of people living with this disorder.

Six Bits A Day,"Hewey Calloway, one of the best-loved cowboys in all of Western fiction, returns in this novel of his younger years as he and his beloved brother Walter leave the family farm in 1889 to find work in the West Texas cow country. The brothers are polar opposites. Walter pines for a sedate life as a farmer, with wife and children; Hewey is a fiddle-footed cowboy content to work at six bits--75 cents--a day on the Pecos River ranch owned by the penny-pinching C.C. Tarpley. Hewey, who ""usually accepted the vagaries of life without getting his underwear in a twist"", is fun-loving and whiskey-drinking. He spends every penny he earns and regularly gets into trouble with his boss--and occasionally with the law--often dragging innocent Walter along. When Walter falls in love with a boarding house girl and begins dreaming of a farmer's life, Hewey jumps at the chance to rescue him from this fate worse than death. He convinces Walter to join him on a mission for Tarpley, driving 600 head of cattle from beyond San Antonio to the Double-C ranch on the Pecos. The journey is both memorable and dangerous: a murderous outlaw is searching for Hewey; and another ruthless character is determined to sabotage the cattle drive. When the drovers reach the Pecos they find Boss Tarpley in the midst of a vicious range feud with Eli Jessup, a neighboring cowman. Hewey and his brother Walter have to get the herd safely across Jessup's land-but how?

Jesus Land: A Memoir (Alex Awards (Awards)),"""A page turner...heart–stopping and enraging...focused, justified, and without a trace of self–pity. Shot through with poignancy."" —New York Times Book Review Over a decade after its first publication, Jesus Land remains deeply resonant with readers. Now with a new preface by the author, this New York Times bestselling memoir is a gripping tale of rage and redemption, hope and humor, morality and malice—and most of all, the truth: that being a good person takes more than just going to church. Julia and her adopted brother, David, are sixteen years old. Julia is white. David is black. It is the mid–1980s and their family has just moved to rural Indiana, a landscape of cottonwood trees, trailer parks, and an all–encompassing racism. At home are a distant mother—more involved with her church's missionaries than her own children—and a violent father. In this riveting and heartrending memoir Julia Scheeres takes us from the Midwest to a place beyond imagining. Surrounded by natural beauty, Escuela Caribe—a religious reform school in the Dominican Republic—is characterized by a disciplinary regime that extracts repentance from its students by any means necessary. Julia and David strive to make it through these ordeals and their tale is relayed here with startling immediacy, extreme candor, and wry humor.",['Julia Scheeres'],Catapult,2012,['Biography & Autobiography'],2.0,5.0,2005-10-12,Jesus Land breakdown,"Great book.

Silent Spring,"Rachel Carson's Silent Spring alerted a large audience to the environmental and human dangers of indiscriminate use of pesticides, spurring revolutionary changes in the laws affecting our air, land, and water. This Penguin Modern Classics edition includes an introduction by Lord Shackleton, a preface by World Wildlife Fund founder Julian Huxley, and an afterword by Carson's biographer Linda Lear. Now recognized as one of the most influential books of the twentieth century, Silent Spring exposed the destruction of wildlife through the widespread use of pesticides. Despite condemnation in the press and heavy-handed attempts by the chemical industry to ban the book, Rachel Carson succeeded in creating a new public awareness of the environment which led to changes in government and inspired the ecological movement. It is thanks to this book, and the help of many environmentalists, that harmful pesticides such as DDT were banned from use in the US and countries around the world. Rachel Carson (1907-64) wanted to be a writer for as long as she could remember. Her first book, Under the Sea Wind, appeared in 1941. Silent Spring, which alerted the world to the dangers of the misuse of pesticides, was published in 1962. Carson's articles on natural history appeared in the Atlantic Monthly, the New Yorker, Reader's Digest and Holiday. An ardent ecologist and preservationist, Carson warned against the dumping of atomic waste at sea and predicted global warming. If you enjoyed Silent Spring, you might like John Christopher's The Death of Grass, also available in Penguin Modern Classics.

Not that I wouldn't have found a lot of American behaviour strange after reading it (I would still have done) but I would have been more aware of my cultural disabilities and how weird I must seem to them.That's the power of this book - you can dip into almost any page, read a paragraph and say ""that's me!"" Kate Fox has studied the English for 10 years with remarkable acuity and she is able to identify behaviours that, to us, are entirely normal but are actually just part of our collective odd English behaviour patterns. When a man I had just been introduced to in America said ""So, tell me all about yourself"" I was left gaping at him in horror; `Watching The English' describes how people in the UK never share personal information unless they know someone particularly well - and in fact most people don't even introduce themselves to start with - my horror was expected and justified as I had never before been called upon to `blow my own trumpet' and it is completely counter to British reserve and our self-effacing nature. Her comments on ignoring other passengers on train journeys, on our national obsession with pets, on queuing, mobile phone use, class distinctions, dislike of fuss and bother and so many other areas rang completely true.What I particularly liked about the book (and that I am English would of course confirm this) was that she wrote with a lot of humour and throw-away one-liners, she wasn't hugely pro-English or anti-English, she wasn't anti-American (despite them being so ODD!) and was able to illustrate her comments through the vast amount of research that she has done, including interviewing English people and foreigners and carrying out experiments herself (such as bumping into people in the street and seeing if they say `sorry' - the English generally do).It's a surprisingly long book and not something you'd sit and read in one go. In fact I think it works best as something you dip into and that's how I've read it over a few days - opening it at random, reading a few pages, then flicking on. It's all subdivided into different headings and subheadings and doesn't really need to be read linearly to be understood. I found myself reading out vast tranches of it to anyone in earshot as it was so amusing and accurate. I read the introduction last of all, having read many comments by Amazon reviews that it was rather hard going - I found the introduction fine, but perhaps that was because by then I had enjoyed the book and found that I very much appreciated the author, her self-deprecating humour and her willingness to share her foibles and those of her family.This book would make an ideal present for any English people out there who want to laugh at themselves (that's all of us), for anyone about to travel to a different culture (to avoid misunderstandings through others' behaviour) and particularly for those living in other countries who want to visit us without putting their foot in it at every conceivable opportunity.",114,127
Slaughter-House Five (First paperback edition),"A special fiftieth anniversary edition of Kurt Vonnegut’s masterpiece, “a desperate, painfully honest attempt to confront the monstrous crimes of the twentieth century” (Time), featuring a new introduction by Kevin Powers, author of the National Book Award finalist The Yellow Birds Selected by the Modern Library as one of the 100 best novels of all time Slaughterhouse-Five, an American classic, is one of the world’s great antiwar books. Centering on the infamous World War II firebombing of Dresden, the novel is the result of what Kurt Vonnegut described as a twenty-three-year struggle to write a book about what he had witnessed as an American prisoner of war. It combines historical fiction, science fiction, autobiography, and satire in an account of the life of Billy Pilgrim, a barber’s son turned draftee turned optometrist turned alien abductee. As Vonnegut had, Billy experiences the destruction of Dresden as a POW. Unlike Vonnegut, he experiences time travel, or coming “unstuck in time.” An instant bestseller, Slaughterhouse-Five made Kurt Vonnegut a cult hero in American literature, a reputation that only strengthened over time, despite his being banned and censored by some libraries and schools for content and language. But it was precisely those elements of Vonnegut’s writing—the political edginess, the genre-bending inventiveness, the frank violence, the transgressive wit—that have inspired generations of readers not just to look differently at the world around them but to find the confidence to say something about it. Authors as wide-ranging as Norman Mailer, John Irving, Michael Crichton, Tim O’Brien, Margaret Atwood, Elizabeth Strout, David Sedaris, Jennifer Egan, and J. K. Rowling have all found inspiration in Vonnegut’s words. Jonathan Safran Foer has described Vonnegut as “the kind of writer who made people—young people especially—want to write.” George Saunders has declared Vonnegut to be “the great, urgent, passionate American writer of our century, who offers us . . . a model of the kind of compassionate thinking that might yet save us from ourselves.” Fifty years after its initial publication at the height of the Vietnam War, Vonnegut's portrayal of political disillusionment, PTSD, and postwar anxiety feels as relevant, darkly humorous, and profoundly affecting as ever, an enduring beacon through our own era’s uncertainties. “Poignant and hilarious, threaded with compassion and, behind everything, the cataract of a thundering moral statement.”—The Boston Globe",['Kurt Vonnegut'],Dial Press Trade Paperback,1999,['Fiction'],1523.0,5.0,2010-12-27,Assigned Reading in Senior Lit Class,"My senior year of High school my english teacher was fresh out of college and brought in a great deal of "" new blood"" to the lit dept.

There's just one small problem: He is also gay. Against her better judgment, and pleas from family and friends, Patty refuses to give up on Ethan.

The Rise of Magic in Early Medieval Europe,"""There are forces better recognized as belonging to human society than repressed or left to waste away or growl about upon its fringes."" So writes Valerie Flint in this powerful work on magic in early medieval Europe. Flint shows how many of the more discerning leaders of the early medieval Church decided to promote non-Christian practices originally condemned as magical--rather than repressing them or leaving them to waste away or ""growl.""

Me Talk Pretty One Day,"A new collection from David Sedaris is cause for jubilation. His recent move to Paris has inspired hilarious pieces, including Me Talk Pretty One Day, about his attempts to learn French. His family is another inspiration. You Cant Kill the Rooster is a portrait of his brother who talks incessant hip-hop slang to his bewildered father. And no one hones a finer fury in response to such modern annoyances as restaurant meals presented in ludicrous towers and cashiers with 6-inch fingernails. Compared by The New Yorker to Twain and Hawthorne, Sedaris has become one of our best-loved authors. Sedaris is an amazing reader whose appearances draw hundreds, and his performancesincluding a jaw-dropping impression of Billie Holiday singing I wish I were an Oscar Meyer weinerare unforgettable.

Tales of the Cthulhu Mythos,"""The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown."" --H. P. LOVECRAFT, ""Supernatural Horror in Literature"" Howard Phillips Lovecraft forever changed the face of horror, fantasy, and science fiction with a remarkable series of stories as influential as the works of Poe, Tolkien, and Edgar Rice Burroughs. His chilling mythology established a gateway between the known universe and an ancient dimension of otherworldly terror, whose unspeakable denizens and monstrous landscapes--dread Cthulhu, Yog-Sothoth, the Plateau of Leng, the Mountains of Madness--have earned him a permanent place in the history of the macabre. In Tales of the Cthulhu Mythos, a pantheon of horror and fantasy's finest authors pay tribute to the master of the macabre with a collection of original stories set in the fearsome Lovecraft tradition: ¸ The Call of Cthulhu by H.

Lusitania: An Epic Tragedy,"On May 7, 1915, toward the end of her 101st eastbound crossing, from New York to Liverpool, England, R.M.S. Lusitania-pride of the Cunard Line and one of the greatest ocean liners afloat-became the target of a terrifying new weapon and a casualty of a terrible new kind of war. Sunk off the southern coast of Ireland by a torpedo fired from the German submarine U-20, she exploded and sank in eighteen minutes, taking with her some twelve hundred people, more than half of the passengers and crew. Cold-blooded, deliberate, and unprecedented in the annals of war, the sinking of the Lusitania shocked the world. It also jolted the United States out of its neutrality and hastened the nation's entry into World War I. In her riveting account of this enormous and controversial tragedy, Diana Preston recalls both a pivotal moment in history and a remarkable human drama. The story of the Lusitania is a window on the maritime world of the early twentieth century: the heyday of the luxury liner, the first days of the modern submarine, and the climax of the decades-long German-British rivalry for supremacy of the Atlantic. Above all, it is the story of the passengers and crew on that fateful voyage-a story of terror and cowardice, of self-sacrifice and heroism, of death and miraculous survival.",['Diana Preston'],Bloomsbury Publishing USA,2015,['History'],3.0,4.0,2006-06-22,Quite Informative,"Lusitania: An epic tragedy encompasses the many tragic details that arose when an attack on non- combatant civilians was initiated during the First world war. The elaborate touches on the impact of the Lusitania's sinking and aftermath are thoroughly described and well defined. Preston knows her Lusitania from inside and out. Her ample research is beyond obvious, and her knowledge of the history is unprecedented. The author has an excellent sense of putting one and one together, and drawing sophisticated and relevant conclusions utilizing a broad array of information, that really gets one thinking. The more intriguing aspects of the book is the sense of wonder and possibility, because many theories are contradicted by the same facts that support them. And this justifies the fact that as outspoken as history truly is, often times it still is one big mystery.The most respectable characteristic of Preston's ""Lusitania"" is the fact that the author recognizes all references to actions and thoughts must be approached with an understanding of and mindset similar to that of the era - 1915. She explains the need to view the attack on the Lusitania from two perspectives, the horrors or war, and the breeching of international law and the humane details of an advanced civilization. Preston addresses the questions left deliberately unanswered, such as the nature of the second explosion aboard the Lusitania, and whether or not it was due to illegal ammunition.*Why did the Lusitania travel so slowly (being one of the swiftest liners) on a straight path in a danger zone?* Was she a pawn to bring the United States into the war?* Was the charge of ""willful murder"" proper? - Against whom was it justified?* Why did the ship sink in 18 minutes?The birth of the vessel, length of the transatlantic run, and Lusitania's influence on World War one are present within the book. How, by the words of Winston Churchill, ""the poor babies who perished in the ocean struck a blow at German power more deadly than could have been achieved by the sacrifice of a hundred thousand fighting men.""Diana is well prepared to shine light on the many conflicting theories regarding the tragedy, and how the image of women drowning with drifting long hair and children cradled in their harms provided the Allies with a huge propaganda advantage. The outrage of the world press is vividly expressed, and the idea that the Lusitania's sinking was much more of a disaster for Germany than Britain was supported and explained. Her use of true logic and hard evidence and facts provide her with sensible conclusions that finally tie together the loose threads of a story left untold.In all reality, I credit Preston with recognizing how the first world war was something in the way of a first step for our own world, towards the devastation of the middle ages and the compelling power of the repetition of history itself. How, the German's use of a chemical war, the unrestricted submarine warfare system, and the murder of 1,198 civilians lead to a new age of barbarism and total war. How times will soon shift to reflect events like Hiroshima, and secure victory despite the once abundant sense of moral. Each high power will follow this prompted path, Preston explains, while the days of clean and noble war have given way to the darkness of our current world, where any such shade of gray is absent in war to come, from 1915, and on.I have given this book a 4/5 simply because parts of it can seem to have more in common with a research paper than a book or story. On the other hand, Preston's thinking is easy to follow, and anyone interested in a world engulfed in war and the outbreak of one tragic event that alters the era itself, is advised to read this book. It'll get you thinking, and change your perspective immediately.",2,2
The knowledge of the holy: The attributes of God : their meaning in the Christian life,"This classic of Christian testimony and devotion explores the attributes of God in words that fly straight to the heart. A superb aid to strengthening and deepening the spiritual life, each chapter begins with a prayer, lucidly discusses a divine aspect -- from God's infinity to God's love -- and relates that aspect to today's world, while pointing always to God's wonder and inscrutability."" A. W. Tozer asserts that the cause of many of our modern spiritual woes is the loss in today's church of a lofty concept of God. He argues persuasively that the cure lies in our rediscovery of God's majesty. ""True religion confronts earth with heaven and brings eternity to bear upon time,"" says the author in his preface, ""The messenger of Christ, though he speaks from God, must also, as the Quakers used to say 'speak to the condition' of his hearers; otherwise he will speak a language known only to himself. His message must be not only timeless but timely. He must speak to his own generation."" The message of this book is indeed both timeless and timely. Tozer is primarily concerned with the loss of the concept of 'majesty' from the popular mind and more importantly in the thinking of the church. He sees the church as having surrendered her once lofty concept of God - not deliberately, but little by little and without her knowledge. With this comes a further loss of religious awe and a sense of the divine presence, of an appropriate spirit of worship and of our ability to withdraw inwardly to meet God in adoring silence. Tozer attempts to address this problem, to go back to the causes of the decline and to understand and correct the errors that have given rise to our loss of a sense of the holy. ""It is impossible to keep our moral practices sound and our inward attitudes right while our idea of God is erroneous or inadequate,"" he tells us.",['A. W.

"In a Dark House (Crombie, Deborah)","An abandoned Southwark warehouse burns next door to a women's shelter for victims of spousal abuse. Within it lies the charred corpse of a female body burned beyond all recognition. At the same time, workers at Guy's Hospital anxiously discuss the disappearance of a hospital administrator -- a beautiful, emotionally fragile young woman who's vanished without a trace. And in an old, dark, rambling London house, nine-year-old Harriet's awful fears won't be silenced -- as she worries about her feuding parents, her schoolwork . . . and the strange woman who is her only companion in this scary, unfamiliar place. Gemma James and Duncan Kincaid -- lovers and former partners -- have their own pressing concerns. But they must put aside private matters to investigate these disturbing cases.

Reading this novel is like looking through the lens of a kaleidoscope and wondering when the swirling colors and shapes will settle into a recognizable pattern. Fortunately, Crombie is highly skilled at developing character and an expert at juggling all of her plot elements, and she carries the reader along effortlessly.Gemma James and Duncan Kincaid have settled into their new house with their children, Kit and Toby. Although they are not married, Gemma and Duncan are a committed couple who have weathered many difficult times together. Their main worry now is an impending court battle against Kit's maternal grandmother, who has filed suit to gain custody of her thirteen-year-old grandson. Kit's grandmother, Eugenia, claims that Duncan and Gemma, who are both Scotland Yard detectives, are too busy with their professional lives to take proper care of a child. Neither Gemma nor Duncan have any intention of surrendering Kit without a fight.""In a Dark House"" is chock full of suspense and criminal mischief. Superintendent Kincaid has been asked by his boss to investigate a suspicious fire and a homicide, which may or may not be connected. As a favor to Winnie Montfort, the wife of Duncan's cousin, Gemma looks into the sudden disappearance of a hospital administrator who had been sharing a house with Winnie's friend. Later, both Duncan and Gemma are on the trail of a child abductor who has kidnapped a young girl but has not made a ransom demand.In lesser hands, this novel might have degenerated into a confusing and melodramatic jigsaw puzzle with too many pieces. However, Crombie masterfully delineates each character clearly and succinctly, and she weaves the various plot threads together with a sure and deft touch. Gemma and Duncan are wonderful protagonists. They are brilliant and dedicated detectives, but they have learned over the years that it is a mistake to always put your job ahead of your family.The large cast of vivid characters includes Fanny Liu, a paralyzed woman who is panic-stricken when her flatmate, Elaine disappears, Rose Kearney, a young and ambitious firefighter who has the instincts of a keen fire investigator, and Dr. Tony Novak, whose bitter divorce from his wife, Laura, has put his beloved daughter, Harriet, at risk. The villains are evil and chilling, and there are many twists and turns to keep the reader turning pages at a fast clip.As always, it is amazing that an American author like Crombie perfectly captures British dialect and atmosphere. Her great success as a novelist, however, stems from her deep understanding of human nature and her ability to tell engrossing stories that combine action, drama, poignancy, and tragedy. She carefully leaves some loose ends untied, and I look forward to her addressing some of them in the next installment of this wonderful series.",9,9
Selected tales and sketches,"The short fiction of a writer who helped to shape the course of American literature. With a determined commitment to the history of his native land, Nathaniel Hawthorne revealed, more incisively than any writer of his generation, the nature of a distinctly American consciousness. The pieces collected here deal with essentially American matters: the Puritan past, the Indians, the Revolution. But Hawthorne was highly - often wickedly - unorthodox in his account of life in early America, and his precisely constructed plots quickly engage the reader's imagination. Written in the 1820s, 30s, and 40s, these works are informed by themes that reappear in Hawthorne's longer works: The Scarlet Letter, The House of the Seven Gables and The Blithedale Romance.

The writing is personal enough to give you a real sense of the emotions of John, Abigail and many of the other actors who John encounters in his momentous life. The history lesson is indeed educational -- even if you consider yourself well educated, there are aspects of the struggle for independence, the Revolutionary War, his travels to Europe and his presidency that will enlighten you. Most significantly for me was the depth of the struggle for independence and the role that John Adams played. It is very clear, after reading McCullough's account, that many players contributed to the breakaway from England, but none contributed more than John Adams. When rattling off the ""founding fathers"", I would typically get through quite a few names before getting to his...no more. John Adams' contributions were in the same gravity as Washington and Jefferson. The paperback version of this book is over 800 pages, but McCullough's writing hurtles you over that obstacle quickly.

Stranger in a Strange Land,"The original uncut edition of STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND by Hugo Award winner Robert A Heinlein - one of the most beloved, celebrated science-fiction novels of all time. Epic, ambitious and entertaining, STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND caused controversy and uproar when it was first published and is still topical and challenging today. Twenty-five years ago, the first manned mission to Mars was lost, and all hands presumed dead. But someone survived...

ABC Murders,Hercule Poirot's mastery of detective skills is tested by a mysterious correspondent who predicts and then executes alphabetical murders,['Agatha Christie'],Macmillan Reference USA,1988,['Fiction'],47.0,3.0,1999-01-08,"well written, but not fantastic","Agatha Christie's A.B.C Murders that has a very interesting plot. In it, a series of murders occurs that have several things in common. First, every murder has a note preceding it that is sent to Hercule Poirot, the heroic detective of the book and the main character in many of Christie's novels. Each note contains the location and date of the next murder. Each note is sent by a man calling himself A.B.C. Second, the murders are all committed in alphabetical order. For instance, Mrs. Ascher was killed in Andover and Betty Bernard was killed in Bexhill. Third, each of the bodies had an A.B.C railway guide lying near or on it. These guides were open to the page containing the town where the murder had been committed. Using clues and connections that the reader will probably not realize exist until the conclusion, Poirot finds the true culprit.A.B.C Murders has both advantages anddisadvantages. One of the most important advantages is that it has a story line with many plot twists and a net of intrigue. Just when you think you know who did it, evidence proves otherwise, which is one reason why I liked it. This kind of twist keeps on happening until the story is resolved. Another good thing about this book is the vocabulary, which is advanced; a dictionary can come in handy while reading this book. Poirot's witty comments in French are both funny and insightful. I only had a few problems with this book. First, Christie presents the material in such a way that it is sometimes confusing to read. Second, Poirot sees the smallest detail, which is a bit unlikely because in this respect he seems a bit superhuman. Third, the murderer always leaves a clue that no one seesexcept Poirot, which is again very unlikely. All in all, I would give this book three stars and saythat if you are looking for a good mystery book to read on the proverbial &quot;dark and stormy night&quot; you might want to pick this up. However, if you are looking for detective fiction with a more realistic plot, I would search for greener pastures.",3,3

Lewis pioneered a new kind of fantasy when he wrote ""The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe"" -- the kind where people from our world somehow get swept into another one. It's old stuff now, but Lewis was among the first to attempt such a thing. Because of its originality, and despite some rather hamhanded allegory, it remains a charmingly written, classic story.To avoid the threat of bombings in London, the four Pevensie kids are sent to stay with a wealthy, eccentric professor in the country. But strange things start to happen when Lucy finds a wardrobe during a game of hide-and-seek -- when she climbs in, she finds a snowy woodland and a friendly faun. Her siblings don't believe her... until peevish Edmund also ventures through, and encounters the beautiful but evil White Witch.Soon all four are wandering through the snowy land of Narnia, encountering mythical creatures and talking animals. They also find that the four of them are at the center of a prophecy that will lead to the return of lion-messiah Aslan, and the downfall of the White Witch. But things don't go according to plan when Edmund defects to the Witch's side...How many fantasy stories are written about kids who crawl through a hedge, wander through a door or pick up a magical object, and immediately are swept off into a medieval land? Lots. And they owe a debt of gratitude to C.S. Lewis, theologian, author, and drinking buddy of ""Lord of the Rings"" author J.R.R. Tolkien.C.S. Lewis' story is, despite being set during World War II, very 19th-century in tone -- very charming, conversational and full of little details. He populates it with a mishmash of mythic creatures such as dryads, fauns, and talking beavers. The one flaw? Lewis gets quite hamhanded with his Christian allegory, such as Aslan's resurrection. However, he has a very good plot and charming characters to balance it out.Those characters deftly avoid being cutesy, especially by virtue of the malicious Edmund, who slowly has a change of heart after falling in with the evil Witch. He's a much more enjoyable character than his noble brother Peter, just because he's so real. And as a counterbalance, there's Lewis's sweet-natured Lucy -- which was also the name of Lewis' granddaughter.Complex characters and still-fresh stories give ""The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe"" -- which is soon to be released as a major movie -- a special ambience. Definitely worth reading.",1,1

Dave Barry Slept Here: A Sort of History of the United States,"“What caused the American Revolution? This is indeed a rhetorical question that for many years historians have begun chapters with. As well they should. For the American Revolution is without a doubt the single most important historical event to occur in this nation except of course for Super Bowl III (Jets 16. Colts 7. This historian won $35).” So goes the skewed sensibility, the muddied mind, the bent pen of one of America's funniest writers, Dave Barry. This time his subject is U.S. history, the way it's never been told before. Every single momentous event and crucial moment is covered, including . . . • The Birthing Contractions of a Nation • Kicking Some British Butt • Barging Westward • The Forging of a Large, Wasteful Bureaucracy • Deep Economic Doo-doo • The Fifties: Peace, Prosperity, Brain Death . . . and right up through the scintillating Reagan-Bush years, during which, Mr. Barry notes, America is steadfastly Napping Toward Glory. If you love to laugh, if you love your country, if you are unaware that “the Sixth Amendment states that if you are accused of a crime, you have a right to a trial before a jury of people too stupid to get out of jury duty,” Dave Barry Slept Here is the book you've been waiting for since 1776. Or at least since Super Bowl III. Praise for Dave Barry Slept Here “A dazzling performance . . . Barry is brilliant.”—The Washington Post Book World “[Dave] Barry turns his formidable wit to the subject of American history, with a result reminiscent of the Reduced Shakespeare Company: The better you know the original, the funnier it gets.”—Los Angeles Times “I fear that Mr. Barry's dream of making millions of dollars through mass sales of his book to a captive audience of innocent schoolchildren will not be realized, and he will have to be content with making readers laugh a lot, as this one did.”—The New York Times Book Review",['Dave Barry'],Ballantine Books,2010,['Humor'],12.0,4.0,2002-06-06,Soooooo funny!,"In true Dave Barry fashion, this book galumphs through all the bigees of American history that you vaguely remember from your high school days.

This book should be required reading for every American history prof! And it's a great summer read, because the pace of the book is quick and it makes you laugh.

The World at Night: A Novel,"“First-rate research collaborates with first-rate imagination. . . . Superb.”—The Boston Globe Paris, 1940. The civilized, upper-class life of film producer Jean Casson is derailed by the German occupation of Paris, but Casson learns that with enough money, compromise, and connections, one need not deny oneself the pleasures of Parisian life. Somewhere inside Casson, though, is a stubborn romantic streak. When he’s offered the chance to take part in an operation of the British secret service, this idealism gives him the courage to say yes. A simple mission, but it goes wrong, and Casson realizes he must gamble everything—his career, the woman he loves, life itself. Here is a brilliant re-creation of France—its spirit in the moment of defeat, its valor in the moment of rebirth. Praise for The World at Night “[The World at Night] earns a comparison with the serious entertainments of Graham Greene and John le Carré. . . . Gripping, beautifully detailed . . . an absorbing glimpse into the moral maze of espionage.”—Richard Eder, Los Angeles Times “[The World at Night] is the world of Eric Ambler, the pioneering British author of classic World War II espionage fiction. . . .

The protagonist, a film producer who initially thinks life can continue as normal, takes us step by step through the transition from sadness to resentment to anger to resistance against a brutal occupying force.Furst's real achievement in this novel is taking the mundane and the normal and weaving them into the difficult and violent world of war and occupation. Everyday experiences like eating, drinking, earning a living, loving and talking are the primary daily behaviors around which the characters interact, but they are all intruded upon by the occupation. This is what makes the book so ""real.""Furst combines history, fiction, and the mysteries of espionage as well as anyone since Eric Ambler. He is always worth reading.",41,45
If the Universe Is Teeming with Aliens ... WHERE IS EVERYBODY?: Fifty Solutions to the Fermi Paradox and the Problem of Extraterrestrial Life,"Given the fact that there are perhaps 400 billion stars in our Galaxy alone, and perhaps 400 billion galaxies in the Universe, it stands to reason that somewhere out there, in the 14-billion-year-old cosmos, there is or once was a civilization at least as advanced as our own. The sheer enormity of the numbers almost demands that we accept the truth of this hypothesis. Why, then, have we encountered no evidence, no messages, no artifacts of these extraterrestrials? In this second, significantly revised and expanded edition of his widely popular book, Webb discusses in detail the (for now!) 75 most cogent and intriguing solutions to Fermi's famous paradox: If the numbers strongly point to the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations, why have we found no evidence of them? Reviews from the first edition: ""Amidst the plethora of books that treat the possibility of extraterrestrial intelligence, this one by Webb ... is outstanding. ... Each solution is presented in a very logical, interesting, thorough manner with accompanying explanations and notes that the intelligent layperson can understand. Webb digs into the issues ... by considering a very broad set of in-depth solutions that he addresses through an interesting and challenging mode of presentation that stretches the mind. ... An excellent book for anyone who has ever asked ‘Are we alone?’."" (W. E. Howard III, Choice, March, 2003) ""Fifty ideas are presented ... that reveal a clearly reasoned examination of what is known as ‘The Fermi Paradox’. ... For anyone who enjoys a good detective story, or using their thinking faculties and stretching the imagination to the limits ... ‘Where is everybody’ will be enormously informative and entertaining. ... Read this book, and whatever your views are about life elsewhere in the Universe, your appreciation for how special life is here on Earth will be enhanced! A worthy addition to any personal library."" (Philip Bridle, BBC Radio, March, 2003) Since gaining a BSc in physics from the University of Bristol and a PhD in theoretical physics from the University of Manchester, Stephen Webb has worked in a variety of universities in the UK. He is a regular contributor to the Yearbook of Astronomy series and has published an undergraduate textbook on distance determination in astronomy and cosmology as well as several popular science books. His interest in the Fermi paradox combines lifelong interests in both science and science fiction.",['Stephen Webb'],Springer,2015,['Science'],2.0,3.0,2006-02-23,"5 stars for the research, 0 for the reasoning","This is a well-researched book that discusses 50 solutions to a paradox posed by Enrico Fermi: if there is intelligent life out there why hasn't it found us yet? Readers interested in this topic should find this book informative and interesting. However, early in his analysis of the solutions it becomes apparent that the author is not only presenting the solutions but trying to discredit each, so that his anwer, which he presents at the end, will be seen as the only reasonable one. To this end he engages in tactics ranging from the straw man fallacy to outright demagoguery.Two examples: he describes an option called the ""singularity"" solution, which basically says that technological societies eventually reach a point of almost god-like power. At that point the population literally abandons the flesh and takes on new lives as wholly artificial super intelligences. With their new god-like perspective they simply have no interest in creatures as mundane as humans.Sounds plausible to me, but what does Webb say? ""Surely not all of the individuals would opt for this super existence, preferring to remain mortal and flesh and blood. Those individuals would explore space till they found us.""Talk about a stretch - Webb ""debunks"" this position by asserting that some sentient creatures would forego eternal life, unlimited power and limitless possibilities to exist a century or so in shells of meat until their inevitable and irreversible deaths. He then says that these technology-shy individuals would proceed to build starships and explore the galaxy, risking their fragile and limited existences in the process. Better not blow too hard on that house of cards, it'll collapse in a heartbeat.He does similiar injustices to the view I favor: the ""strange universe"" solution. According to this proposal societies that explore space eventually discover not only how to travel faster than light but also how to build wormholes to distant galaxies and even parallel universes. Thus, with an eternity of different worlds to explore they simply haven't had time to get to us yet.Webb derides this view, saying it is the preferred solution of UFO and alien abduction enthusiasts. Excuse me, Dr. Webb, but I think that alien abductions are pure baloney and that 99.9 percent of UFO sightings are easily explained (the remaining ones are, in my non-humble opinion, probably sightings of classified military craft). He also says that concepts like parallel universes aren't necessary to explain the universe and thus should be ignored.Apparently the good doctor has been in isolation for the past couple of decades. Else he might have read some of the numerous articles by his colleagues that posit parallel universes as inevitable consequences of both an inflationary big bang as well as string theory. In addition a good many scientists believe that the many universes theory is the only non-theistic way to answer the Strong Anthropic Principle.There is one huge problem with Webb's argumentation that I frankly feel reveals him to be a scholar of at best middling abilities. That problem is this: in his efforts to debunk all positions but his own he consistently says (I paraphrase here) ""the problem with this solution is that, while it may apply to some extra terrestrial beings it surely cannot apply to all, thus it fails as a solution to Fermi's paradox.""I was so astounded by this blunder that I reread the book to make sure I didn't misunderstand him.The obvious response to this line of reasoning it that there may very well be multiple answers to the paradox.Some of the aliens may have blown themselves up, others may have escaped into another dimension, still others may have no desire to explore space, yet others may be signaling us now but on a level we cannot yet understand, and so on and so on.In the end I recommend this book, but with strong reservations. In my opinion it would have been much better if written by, say, Michio Kaku, a scientist whose popular works are among the best available. I recommend all of his books very highly, especially one I'm sure Dr. Webb would love, ""Parallel Worlds."" Comments? wordsmiththreetwooneathotmail.com.",25,28

The problem is that, although I'm an ordinary-sized guy, the thing is so big that my hands get tired holding the thing open.Boy, do I regret giving my 3 Ballantine paperbacks away when I bought this thing. This is one of the only books I own that is pretty much unreadable for physical reasons.Note: the edition this review applies to is ISBN-13: 978-0261103252.

The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,"The off-beat and occasionally extraterrestrial journeys, notions, and acquaintances of galactic traveler Arthur Dent are illustrated with digitally generated graphic images and tricky visual puns",['Douglas Adams'],Harmony,1994,['Science'],2.0,5.0,2010-07-30,Light and fun reading,"This book is a surprisingly quick and easy read. Douglas Adams' sarcasm, wit, and subtle (or sometimes not-so-subtle, but outright ridiculous) humor make for an afternoon's delightful entertainment. On the surface the story seems random and shallow. There is very little character development, if any at all. Basically, how the characters are introduced when they first appear is how they'll stay -- the reluctant, anxious Arthur; the zany Zaphod; the hopelessly depressed and cynical Marvin -- they remain in their molds throughout the story. The plot also appears to be just barely existent. We know that Zaphod is searching for something, but even he doesn't know what it is, and whatever it happens to be, who cares? -- we never find it anyway. The ""fight scenes"" in the story seem to be more of a spoof or parody than anything else. ""We don't want to shoot you!"" ""Well, that suits me just fine!"" Adams also pokes fun at things we hold near and dear to our hearts, such as government (ha!), philosophy (ha ha!), and poetry (wha?). The chapter on the philosophers literally had me laughing out loud. No matter who you are, there's got to be SOME kind of humor in here for you!",1,1
"Claudius, the god and his wife Messalina","Depicts the turbulent life of a Roman emperor, reconstructing the decadence of the Roman world",['Robert Graves'],Vintage,1989,['Fiction'],2.0,4.0,2000-09-25,"Read 'I, Claudius' first....","Rightfully, this book has around 20% of the number of reviews as does the first half of the life of the same man by the same author. This is not nearly as good of a book as 'I, Claudius', I doubt that anyone reading this would be much surprised at this. 'I, Claudius' is considered as a classic of the English language whereas this is just a fairly strong 'good' book.There are a number of reasons for this. First, the first half (well, chronologically more...) of Claudius's life provides a better ground for Graves to do his job; he also seems to identify more with the character before he became emperor. When Claudius loses his humor and perspective, the whole of the series loses it's brilliance....Setting this aside, this is still a highly entertaining and worthwhile book. I loved the first work better; I'd read it first. If you have read it, I am assuming, you liked it enough to come back to this page looking for more.

World on Fire: How Exporting Free Market Democracy Breeds Ethnic Hatred and Global Instability,"Describes the potential dangers of globalization and the exportation of free-market democracy, arguing that they do not spread wealth evenly and produce increased ethnic conflict, violence, ethnonationalism, and other disastrous results.",['Amy Chua'],Doubleday Books,2003,['Business & Economics'],5.0,5.0,2005-10-08,Great book on globalization,"In the last 10 years there have been a wealth of literature on globalization and its effects. Many, if not most of these, have come from white men living in Western nations who have in general benefited from globalization. Now we have a book by a Chinese woman who has personal experience of the negative effects of globalization. With this insight, a lot of research, and references of other works in the same genre, the author has written an intelligently argued, well written, easy to read, and comprehensive account of globalization in the 20th century with an emphasis on the decade since the end of the Cold War.In this book, she looks at the globalization that has occurred in Russia, China, Latin America, Indonesia and several other areas of the world. She also looks at Germany prior to and during the Nazi period. From these case studies, and by looking at the history of the US itself, she shows that the combination of free market economics and representative democracy that the US has convinced other countries to adopt in the last 20 - 30 years has led to economic and social chaos in those very same countries. And the worse part, the US has rarely adopted these same practices that it has imposed on other countries. In fact, it has even down the opposite. As a clear example, she illustrates how the US adopted the New Deal as a remedy for the Great Depression. Yet, when other countries have financial difficulties, the US, through the World Bank and the IMF, encourages those countries to trim spending, balance its budget, and tighten its financial policy. The result, these countries have their economies screwed over for years or even decades.The added insight that this book provides over others in the same genre is how the combination of popular democracy fused with free-market economics often leads to social tensions broken down along racial or religious lines. These tensions occasionally break out into civil strife, hence worsening the economic situation.What the book does not do is blame globalization, democracy, or free market economics. The book does blame the policy of one-size-fits-all reforms that the US has forced onto other nations.All in all a great book and worthy of reading for any history, economics, or poly sci major.",0,1
Interview With The Vampire SIGNED First Edition,"From #1 New York Times bestselling author Anne Rice, this sensuously written spellbinding classic remains 'the most successful vampire story since Bram Stoker's Dracula' (The Times) In a darkened room a young man sits telling the macabre and eerie story of his life - the story of a vampire, gifted with eternal life, cursed with an exquisite craving for human blood. Anne Rice's compulsively readable novel is arguably the most celebrated work of vampire fiction since Bram Stoker's Dracula was published in 1897. When Interview with the Vampire was originally published the Washington Post said it was: called Interview with the Vampire a 'thrilling, strikingly original work of the imagination . . . sometimes horrible, sometimes beautiful, always unforgettable'.

Three Junes,This strong and memorable debut novel draws the reader deeply into the lives of several central characters during three separate Junes spanning ten years.,['Julia Glass'],Anchor Books,2002,['Fiction'],62.0,3.0,2006-12-13,Written with the skill of a painter.,"And, yes, the title of my review is either a backhanded compliment or a roundabout criticism. You may choose.What I mean by it is this-- Glass is skilled at the small vignette. The individual sections of the work have been justly praised for their warmness and luminosity. The first section, ""Collies"", is particularly strong. She writes the moments extremely well. She captures and unfolds them like little bits of paper, or found photographs. I enjoyed the book for her pure skill at exactly these things.Unfortunately, Three Junes works much less well as a novel. The interwoven time threads become unnecessarily complicated. The structure forces the reader to work for an understanding of the plot. That work remains unrewarded, since the plot isn't weighty enough to really sustain that kind of work. The book functions best as a kind of character study, moments-in-time book. The moments of realization themselves are in the end rather standard-- very sentimental and nearly banal. The structure focuses the reader away from the strongest parts of the book and onto the weakest, unfortunately.As a first novel, it was enjoyable and impressive. I would recommend the book. Think of it as the literary equivalent of sitting on a hot beach in the summer. It does not need to be the nicest beach or the most beautiful in order to bask in the general warmth.",10,11

"Immanuel Kant's Critique of pure reason,","The masterpiece of the father of modern philosophy A seminal text of modern philosophy, Immanuel Kant's Critique of Pure Reason (1781) made history by bringing together two opposing schools of thought: rationalism, which grounds all our knowledge in reason, and empiricism, which traces all our knowledge to experience. Published here in a lucid reworking of Max Müller's classic translation, the Critique is a profound investigation into the nature of human reason, establishing its truth, falsities, illusions, and reality.

Ayn Rand has about the same relationship to serious philosophy as McDonalds does to good cooking. She hated Kant, but never quite seemed to understand him. No surprise - he's hard.Which is the second point. This is not an easy book at all. That's why it's most often assigned to graduate students. Even undergrads can easily get a philosophy degree without ever touching this book. It's bloody hard. This is because, well, its ideas are radical and difficult, and because Kant is a careful philosopher.It is not, and this is my third point, because Kant is a bad writer. Quite the opposite. He's a great writer. The fact of the matter is, though, that his subject matter is not exactly a page-turner. But, I mean, what do you expect. You're reading academic philosophy. There's a handful of academic books that are both worthwhile and fun to read, and that's just a fact of life. Kant, however, is quite clear - indeed, he does the service of going over his points more than once - a luxury you won't get when you advance to Hegel. Furthermore, believe it or not, there are jokes in Kant. The best of them is a footnote, in which he notes that &quot;Deficiancy in judgment is that which is ordinarily referred to as stupidity, and for such a failing their is no remedy.&quot;Unfortunately, it's all too common on Amazon to bash academic books because they're hard, obscure, or poorly written. The fact of the matter is that these books are not for everyone. They're for specialists and scholars, and are written in a language that is appropriately technical to that task. You don't go and bash medical and scientific books for being too hard for you. Give philosophy a break, and recognize this book as what it is - one of the most important contributions to a scholarly field ever.",165,176

Vonnegut is a black humorist, fantasist and satirist, a man disposed to deep and comic reflection on the human dilemma.”—Life “His black logic . . . gives us something to laugh about and much to fear.”—The New York Times Book Review",['Kurt Vonnegut'],Dial Press,2009,['Fiction'],39.0,4.0,2004-11-30,Player Piano,Kurt Vonnegut's Player Piano is an interesting book about technology being mankind's ultimate undoing. The book really does not get much credit for being ahead of the curve especially considering how popular the novel 1984 is. I find this fear towards technology very fascinating. There is a great deal of fear of the unknown and change. This fear manifests itself in all forms of culture.While not as good a Slaughterhouse-Five Vonnegut's Player Piano is a great book about total control and manipulation. It is funny and well written. For anyone that is a Vonnegut fan this is required reading.,0,0
The Reader,"Hailed for its coiled eroticism and the moral claims it makes upon the reader, this mesmerizing novel is a story of love and secrets, horror and compassion, unfolding against the haunted landscape of postwar Germany. When he falls ill on his way home from school, fifteen-year-old Michael Berg is rescued by Hanna, a woman twice his age. In time she becomes his lover—then she inexplicably disappears. When Michael next sees her, he is a young law student, and she is on trial for a hideous crime. As he watches her refuse to defend her innocence, Michael gradually realizes that Hanna may be guarding a secret she considers more shameful than murder.",['Bernhard Schlink'],Vintage,2001,['Fiction'],222.0,4.0,2009-04-29,As A Whole I Liked It,"With the first part of the story, I felt that it did an excellent job intriguing the reader. Some of the reviews see this as a love story or one of pedophilia, but I don't really think either of these views are correct. What Hanna did was pedophilia but I do not think this was the focus. In the same instance, I do not think Hanna ever really loved him. It was about the boy's love and devotion to her. I found that the writing for the court room scene was a little much. What he wrote could have been cut down in half. He continually wrote on how her neck tensed or what her body language was for pages on end, when we just could have heard the story of the victims and the trial. At first I did not like the ending, but after thinking about it I changed my mind. Sometimes we hold on to memories because we don't want to think any different of how things can be, and the reality of change can really frighten us. It was kind of like the Great Gatsby where he wanted to hold on to this image that was just not true. I think the beggining is great, the middle is a little bland, and the ending really makes you think.",0,0

Mustang 1964-1/2-1973,"The first-generation Mustang is an enduring classic but it was built using 50-year-old technology. These cars use antiquated equipment that includes drum brakes, breaker points ignition systems, and 14-inch steel wheels. The OEM running gear is obsolete by today’s standards but all of these Mustangs can turn into high-performance street machines that can compete with late-model Mustangs. While certain special-build and high-performance models should be preserved, many common V-8 Mustangs can be transformed into high-performance cars that rival the new cars of today. The Mustang can be upgraded and modified into a true driving machine by installing aftermarket suspension, steering, and driveline technology. Mustang expert and former Ford engineer Frank Bohanan explains how to perform simple and important bolt-on upgrades that radically increase performance. He explains the rationale and process of installing a crate engine, big high-performance brake kits, coil-over shocks, tubular A-arms, multi-link rear suspension, and many other projects that increase performance by leaps and bounds. From mild to wild, you are shown how to upgrade each component group in the car by stages according to budget and difficulty. These components include engine, transmission, rear differential, front suspension, rear suspension, steering, chassis, electrics, interior, tires, wheels, and more. By completing these procedures and product installs, you can complete an improved street car, a high-performance street car, or a street/track-day car.

Wicked: The Grimmerie is here. Some may be wondering if they should buy this book, and I'm here to tell you.The Good News: The cover and design of the book is amazing. The cover looks old and worn and is even padded. The intricate designs are textured and the book is nice and heavy and thick. The inside design is incredible. Each page (printed on very heavy paper) is made to look old, worn and stained and it's wonderful to look at. As for the actual contents... wow. The production photos are brilliantly printed and include photos from the following casts: Original Broadway Cast, 2nd Broadway Cast (Jennifer Laura Thompson and Joey McIntyre), Original Tour Cast (Stephanie J. Block and Kendra Kassebaum), and the 3rd Broadway Cast (Shoshana Bean and David Ayers). There are very few new photos but there are some. Most of them are from the tour cast (most of Kendra and some of Stephanie and one small one of Carole Kane). There are many interviews with every cast member and many from Gregory Maguire (writer of Wicked the novel) and Stephen Shwartz and Winnie Holtzman (writer of script). There is a step-by-step page of how Stephanie gets green before each show. They have a page dedicated to the dance Elphaba does in ""Dancing Through Life"" and they teach it to us step-by-step. They have many photos of props and sets and wigs, as well as original costume and set sketches. There is a handwritten page from the book and an early version of Defying Gravity. There is commentary on each song by Mr. Shwartz and this isn't even all of it. So much information to soak up!The Wicked News: Unlike what some people are saying, the book DOES NOT INCLUDE THE FULL SCRIPT. There are bits of dialogue and a lot of it is summed up in a few sentences. (The Cornfield Scene is completely gone) They cut whole scenes (which is dumb, they are all spoiler free about it, even though they talk about the same parts in interviews). I was so hoping they would make a huge deal about the script and splash the libretto with tons of photos from each scene... It's very, very disappointing, yes. Very. But... ah, well. They also didn't include Elphaba's spells like they said they would. There is also a sad lack of production photos. There are so many wonderful photos and they don't use NEARLY as much as they should have... You should also know they don't include the 4th Broadway cast (Megan Hilty, Ben Vereen) or ANY of the Chicago cast (Ana Gastyer and Kate Reinders)... that really bites. The Chicago sit-down cast is only mentioned and that is a shame. If you are an Original Cast fan you may be slightly disappointed. Instead of using only the original cast photos (like the RENT ""bible"") they mix and match all the different casts. This would be fine except that if you are a big fan or the Chicago cast or the current Broadway cast (as of Fall 2005) you will be disappointed.But over all, an AMAZING book. Buy it! It's a must for every Wicked fan. A MUST. This is also a wonderful gift.",144,154

Within it lies the charred corpse of a female body burned beyond all recognition. At the same time, workers at Guy's Hospital anxiously discuss the disappearance of a hospital administrator -- a beautiful, emotionally fragile young woman who's vanished without a trace. And in an old, dark, rambling London house, nine-year-old Harriet's awful fears won't be silenced -- as she worries about her feuding parents, her schoolwork . . . and the strange woman who is her only companion in this scary, unfamiliar place. Gemma James and Duncan Kincaid -- lovers and former partners -- have their own pressing concerns. But they must put aside private matters to investigate these disturbing cases. Yet neither Gemma nor Duncan realize how closely the cases are connected -- or how important their resolutions will be for an abducted young child who is frightened, alone . . . and in serious peril.",['Deborah Crombie'],Avon,2005,['Fiction'],11.0,5.0,2004-10-30,"A kaleidoscope of intrigue, arson, and murder.","Deborah Crombie's latest Gemma James/Duncan Kincaid mystery, ""In a Dark House,"" is a blend of three or four plot lines that seem unrelated but eventually converge. Reading this novel is like looking through the lens of a kaleidoscope and wondering when the swirling colors and shapes will settle into a recognizable pattern. Fortunately, Crombie is highly skilled at developing character and an expert at juggling all of her plot elements, and she carries the reader along effortlessly.Gemma James and Duncan Kincaid have settled into their new house with their children, Kit and Toby. Although they are not married, Gemma and Duncan are a committed couple who have weathered many difficult times together. Their main worry now is an impending court battle against Kit's maternal grandmother, who has filed suit to gain custody of her thirteen-year-old grandson. Kit's grandmother, Eugenia, claims that Duncan and Gemma, who are both Scotland Yard detectives, are too busy with their professional lives to take proper care of a child. Neither Gemma nor Duncan have any intention of surrendering Kit without a fight.""In a Dark House"" is chock full of suspense and criminal mischief. Superintendent Kincaid has been asked by his boss to investigate a suspicious fire and a homicide, which may or may not be connected. As a favor to Winnie Montfort, the wife of Duncan's cousin, Gemma looks into the sudden disappearance of a hospital administrator who had been sharing a house with Winnie's friend. Later, both Duncan and Gemma are on the trail of a child abductor who has kidnapped a young girl but has not made a ransom demand.In lesser hands, this novel might have degenerated into a confusing and melodramatic jigsaw puzzle with too many pieces. However, Crombie masterfully delineates each character clearly and succinctly, and she weaves the various plot threads together with a sure and deft touch. Gemma and Duncan are wonderful protagonists. They are brilliant and dedicated detectives, but they have learned over the years that it is a mistake to always put your job ahead of your family.The large cast of vivid characters includes Fanny Liu, a paralyzed woman who is panic-stricken when her flatmate, Elaine disappears, Rose Kearney, a young and ambitious firefighter who has the instincts of a keen fire investigator, and Dr. Tony Novak, whose bitter divorce from his wife, Laura, has put his beloved daughter, Harriet, at risk. The villains are evil and chilling, and there are many twists and turns to keep the reader turning pages at a fast clip.As always, it is amazing that an American author like Crombie perfectly captures British dialect and atmosphere. Her great success as a novelist, however, stems from her deep understanding of human nature and her ability to tell engrossing stories that combine action, drama, poignancy, and tragedy. She carefully leaves some loose ends untied, and I look forward to her addressing some of them in the next installment of this wonderful series.",9,9

The Price of Disobedience: The Battle of the River Plate Reconsidered,"""Naval scholar Eric Grove reassesses the first British naval encounter of World War II - the Battle of the River Plate. In late 1939, a force from the Royal Navy engaged the German battleship Graf Spee, which had been raiding commercial shipping in the southwest Atlantic. Though the Graf Spee was outnumbered, it inflicted serious damage to the British ships before taking refuge in the harbor at Montivideo, Uruguay. Four days later her commander, assuming a much superior force waited for him, scuttled his ship and then committed suicide. This controversial story of risk and naval strategy has been told before, but Grove has unearthed previously unpublished sources to provide a definitive account of the battle and throw new light on the motivation of the Graf Spee's captain. A thought-provoking book, it will attract naval historians and others with an interest in World War II.""--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc. All Rights Reserved",['Eric Grove'],Naval Inst Press,2001,['History'],1.0,5.0,2001-11-26,An Old Song Newly and Nicely Sung,"Eric Grove again proves why he's among the best of today's military historians with a fresh and insightful look at the classic December 1939 confrontation between the Graf Spee and Harwood's cruiser squadron in the South Atlantic. Purists consider this the last of the &quot;old fashioned&quot; naval battles -- pre-ULTRA, and so on. Grove makes a compelling case for the fact that regardless of the state of technology, the human factor remains key to the outcome of battles. The author's portrait of Langsdorff -- &quot;warts and all&quot; -- is free of the propaganda-induced biases that have plagued some other writers. The book shows the man to be undone in large part by his desire to make a definitive statement about the effectiveness of German sea power in the earliest days of the war, and his willingness to do so in spite of strict orders from his superiors to avoid engagements with enemy warships. The author's portrait of Harwood, Bell, and the others on the Allied side is cogent and insightful as well. Grove's analysis of the (relative in-)effectiveness of the gunnery on both sides is well presented, and he does a good job of interpreting the Graf Spee's battle damage in terms of its effects on the vessel's fighting and seakeeping capabilities, should a breakout from Montevideo have been attempted. He does the same with the intricate post-battle political sparring that helped seal Graf Spee's destiny, and offers a comprehensive look at the fates of the people involved on both sids of the fighting. Grove also provides some brief but interesting commentary on the 1956 movie done on the Battle. Throughout the book he makes minimal use of &quot;hindsight&quot; and succeeds in presenting a familiar story in a fresh and compelling manner. The only flaws I found in the book could have been rectified by some careful proofreading; in one instance the date of the battle moves from December to January and in another the word &quot;judgment&quot; is spelled two different ways on the same page. But the book overall is an excellent addition to the WWII naval history cannon and delivers keen insights into one of the war's most publicized engagements. Highly recommended!!",17,17
"The abolition of man; or, Reflections on education with special reference to the teaching of English in the upper forms of schools, (University of Durham. Riddell memorial lectures)","The Abolition of Man is a 1943 book by C. S. Lewis. It is subtitled ""Reflections on education with special reference to the teaching of English in the upper forms of schools,"" and uses that as a starting point for a defense of objective value and natural law, and a warning of the consequences of doing away with or ""debunking"" those things. It defends science as something worth pursuing but criticizes using it to debunk values-the value of science itself being among them-or defining it to exclude such values. The book was first delivered as a series of three evening lectures at King's College, Newcastle, part of the University of Durham, as the Riddell Memorial Lectures on February 24-26, 1943","['C S Lewis', 'C. S. (Clive Staples) Lewis, C. S. (Clive Staples)']",Createspace Independent Publishing Platform,2018,[],28.0,3.0,2009-11-23,"Mixed, but worth reading","This book offers three essays: Men Without Chests, The Way, and The Abolition of Man. The first two form a coherent whole. They should lead logically to the third, which I prefer to consider separately. At their core, these first two 1944 essays address a cultural attitude that had been building at least since the 1920s, and that came to the forefront in the later part of the century. That attitude has many variations and names including post-modernism and post-structuralism, which hold at their core the rejection of any social or esthetic theory as inherently superior to another. I find it easy to dismiss by applying its logic to itself, but Lewis gives a clear and well-developed argument for the vacuity of such nihilism. That foundation lies in Lewis's Way, a kind of law of human nature that can be found across nearly all cultures and all centuries that have left records. Although he borrows from Eastern tradition in using the term 'The Way,' most of his historical support lies within the Western canon. Then within this body of thought, he demonstrates how deconstruction not only collapses through internal inconsistency, it goes against the grain so empirically visible in all of human doings.The third essay, from which the book gets its title, I find less compelling. Although he claims not to be anti-scientific, he seems to find little worth salvage in the intellectual exercise of understanding the physical world, especially the living portions of that world. Lewis appears to lack the scientists' experience of wonder, awe, and underlying unity that come from deeper understanding, experiences that can be profoundly moving and motivating. Based on his own lack, Lewis assumes that there is no such awe, so that understanding must somehow omit or even run counter to the feelings and values that make us human - an error of ignorance that C.P. Snow's essay onThe Two Cultures (Canto)drew into sharp relief.Lewis then observes that any technological advance gives power, in particular power over other people. By way of example, he asserts that contraceptive technology gives absolute power over people who would otherwise have been born, condemning them to nonexistence. This makes sense only in a predestined world where every human that ever will live has already been placed on the future time line, and where technology somehow stands outside this predetermined universe and corrupts it. It also ignores the life-saving technologies that allow more people to survive to reproduction, so that their otherwise-impossible children and grandchildren add to that predestined universe.Then using the language of 1940s eugenics and psychological conditioning, Lewis imagines a world in which technocrats define the bodies and minds of the entire generation after their own, and therefore of all future generations. Since 1940s-style eugenics could only remove alleles from the species genome, and since conditioning can only block choices that would otherwise have been open, Lewis gets away carried envisioning the losses that would necessarily ensue. Although he might be horrified by some ramifications of recent biotechnology, Lewis's argument does not admit the possibility of broadening the definition of humankind or the abilities possible to our species. A genetic increase in intelligence would not eliminate alternatives, as Lewis fears, but increase them. Lewis's concerns about the motivations of those implementing any such change remain valid, and I think changes in popular culture identified as ""dumbing down"" bring his fears to life. Short of nuclear annihilation of the species, however, his fears seem like hysteria about hypotheticals.As much as I respect Lewis's reasoning and humanity, I find this book of limited value. It offers some positive suggestions about maintaining a strong, humane culture. Unfortunately, the title chapter undermines any good I found in it.-- wiredweird",4,8

Cartesian Sonata: and Other Novellas,"From the award-winning author of The Tunnel and Finding a Form--four interrelated novellas that explore Mind, Matter, and God. In the first novella, Gass redefines Descartes' philosophy. God is a writer in a constant state of fumble. Mind is represented by a housewife who is a modern-day Cassandra. And Matter is, what (and who) else but the helpless and confused husband of Mind. In the novella that follows, the concept of salvation is explored through material possessions--a collection of kitsch--as a traveling businessman is slowly lost in the sheer surfeit of matter in a small Illinois town. In another, Gass explores the mind's ability to escape. A young woman growing up in ruralIowa finds herself losing touch with the physical world as she loses herself in the poetry of Elizabeth Bishop. And in ""The Master of Secret Revenges,"" God appears in the form of Descartes' evil demon, Lucifer, as Gass chronicles the life of a young man named Luther and his development from his devilish youth to his demonic adulthood. A profound exploration of good and evil, philosophy and action, filled with the wit and style that have defined the work of William Gass.",['William H. Gass'],Knopf,2013,['Fiction'],1.0,5.0,2009-05-25,One of the better writers most likely not to be read....,"-- ""Cartesian Sonata"" is one of those works of postmodern fiction that you'd be hard-pressed to say, with any authority, what it's really about...unless you read the flyleaf provided by the publisher.-- According to which, in the first of the four novellas collected here, Gass has re-imagined the philosophy of Decartes with God as a befuddled writer, his wife as Mind in the form of a modern-day Cassandra.....etc etc.-- Really? So that's what it was about? Who'd ever guess? How, for that matter, did the person who wrote the copy, unless it was Gass himself, pulling our leg just a little bit.-- Philosophical allusions do indeed abound in ""Cartesian Sonata""--the collection and each of the novellas that comprise it--but to fix a pat and reductive interpretation on these stories is misleading...and a mistake.-- What are they about? In general, they are about how we interpret/misinterpret the world around us and try to gain some degree of mastery and control over it through signs, symbols, and objects.-- In this sense, using Descartes as a touchstone is perhaps of some help. Is there anything we know for certain? If so, how so? ""I think therefore I am."" Maybe. But the further we stray from that citadel of ""I"" the less clear everything becomes.-- A woman harboring a possibly lethal obsession with the poetry and the private lives of Elizabeth Bishop and Marianne Moore. A traveling accountant who finds ""salvation"" in a scrupulously appointed bed and breakfast. A man who's devoted his life to the mastery of petty vengeance in theory and practice. The dysfunctional marriage of a dying psychic and an insurance salesman.-- Gass riffs off these unlikely scenarios with a great deal of wit, erudition, and imagination. He's a fantastic prose stylist, the kind that some readers will find unreadable precisely because he's so good; he stretches, twists, and redesigns the language into what amounts to a prose rollercoaster.

The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference (Wheeler Compass),An introduction to the Tipping Point theory explains how minor changes in ideas and products can increase their popularity and how small adjustments in an individual's immediate environment can alter group behavior.,['Malcolm Gladwell'],"Wheeler Publishing, Incorporated",2003,['Reference'],4218.0,5.0,2002-01-19,Tipping Point,"Malcolm Gladwell's bestselling book, The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference, illustrates real world events that served as tipping points to epidemics. A tipping point is the one dramatic moment where everything changes at once and an epidemic begins. More importantly, Gladwell explains why some ideas, behaviors and/or products start epidemics and others don't; and what we can do to deliberately start and control positive epidemics of our own.According to Gladwell, the three agents of change in epidemics are: The law of the few, the stickiness factor and the power of context. The law of the few refers to the fact that some people (Gladwell labels them connectors, mavens and salesmen) matter more than others. The law states that the success of any kind of epidemic is heavily dependent on the involvement of these few, influential messengers. The stickiness factor refers to the point that in order for a epidemical message to be contagious, it must be memorable, able to create change and drive people to action. The power of context describes that small changes in context are important in tipping epidemics. Gladwell states that if you want to bring about fundamental change in people's belief and behavior, you need to create a community around them, where those new beliefs could be practiced, expressed and nurtured.Using interesting and well-known examples and case studies, Gladwell explores how social epidemics work and what can be learned from them. Tipping Point serves as an inspiration to everyone, whether he or she is causing an epidemic in a classroom or boardroom. Gladwell gives hope that one by one, we can help change the world.",3,6
Out of America: A Black Man Confronts Africa,"Nothing in Keith Richburg's long and respected journalistic career at the Washington Post prepared him for what he would encounter as the paper's correspondent in Africa. He found a continent where brutal murder had become routine, where dictators and warlords silenced dissent with machine guns and machetes, and where starvation had become depressingly common. With a great deal of personal anguish, Richburg faced a difficult question: If this is Africa, what does it mean to be an African American? In this provocative and unvarnished account of his three years on the continent of his ancestors, Richburg takes us on a extraordinary journey that sweeps from Somalia to South Africa, showing how he confronted the divide between his African racial heritage and his American cultural identity.",['Keith B.

That Keith Richburg is an American, not an African?That such an astoundingly banal revelation is actually controversial in America speaks volumes about American ignorance of the outside world.This book makes excellent points about American race relations, and paints a compelling portrait of the three years the author spent in Africa. As an understanding of Africa it is wanting. The guy spoke no African language and had remarkably little preparation for his job. At the end of three years he was still so clueless about African culture he didn't realize that a gap between one's front teeth is considered beautiful in Africa. And while he does point out in the paperback reprint that he did report from several other African countries, his observation that &quot;Good news is no news.&quot; doesn't seem to have made him realize that as a reporter he was constantly exposed to the worst side of Africa today, and missed ordinary life in sle! epy villages. To most Africans I know, this year's rainfall is the most important news.Who is to blame for this? I think his superiors who sent him there. I noticed that both his predecessor and successor were also black. Does the _Washington Post_ think that blacks have some kind of special cultural insight into Africa, that they don't need the language and culture training that any good reporter should get before going overseas? Or is Nairobi their idea of a &quot;Jim Crow&quot; assignment, to keep black reporters away from real news, which whites are supposed to report?Granted that Africa is going through some tough times, but I wonder what his take on Europe would have been if most of what he had seen had been Northern Ireland and the former Yugoslavia.Let us have reporters, of all colors, who are better trained in the languages and cultures of the regions of the world they report on.",3,10

Unfortunately, I think this book is too short and does not give enough information about the characters to make the deeper context very significant. I found myself reading that last few pages thinking, ""Okay, I'm supposed to care here.

Bodies are Where You Find Them,"A disappearing corpse draws Miami PI Mike Shayne into a deadly political conspiracy in this hardboiled mystery that inspired the film Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. A year after marrying the toughest PI in Miami, Phyllis Shayne longs for a few weeks alone with her husband. She and Mike are about to board a train to New York when a client shows up at the door. Her face gray and her voice slurred, the mysterious woman passes out before she’s able to get through her story. Mike carries the stranger to his spare bedroom and, trying to save his wife from worry, tells Phyllis to go on to the train station without him; he’ll meet her in a few days.

Lord of the Flies,"William Golding’s unforgettable classic of boyhood adventure and the savagery of humanity comes to Penguin Classics in a stunning Graphic Deluxe Edition with a new foreword by Lois Lowry As provocative today as when it was first published in 1954, Lord of the Flies continues to ignite passionate debate with its startling, brutal portrait of human nature. William Golding’s compelling story about a group of very ordinary boys marooned on a coral island has been labeled a parable, an allegory, a myth, a morality tale, a parody, a political treatise, and even a vision of the apocalypse. But above all, it has earned its place as one of the indisputable classics of the twentieth century for readers of any age. This Penguin Classics Graphic Deluxe Edition features an array of special features to supplement the novel, including a foreword by Lois Lowry, an introduction by Stephen King, an essay by E. M. Forster, an essay on teaching and reading the novel and suggestions for further exploration by scholar Jennifer Buehler, and an extended note by E. L. Epstein, the publisher of the first American paperback edition of Lord of the Flies.

Brothers K,"A NEW YORK TIMES NOTABLE BOOK Once in a great while a writer comes along who can truly capture the drama and passion of the life of a family. David James Duncan, author of the novel The River Why and the collection River Teeth, is just such a writer.

This touching, uplifting novel spans decades of loyalty, anger, regret, and love in the lives of the Chance family. A father whose dreams of glory on a baseball field are shattered by a mill accident. A mother who clings obsessively to religion as a ward against the darkest hour of her past. Four brothers who come of age during the seismic upheavals of the sixties and who each choose their own way to deal with what the world has become.

Death in the Silent Places,"From the master of adventure behind the classic Death in the Long Grass, former big-game hunter Peter Hathaway Capstick now turns from his own exploits to those of some of the greatest hunters of the past with Death in the Silent Places. With his characteristic color and flair, Capstick recalls the extraordinary careers of men like Colonel J.H. Patterson and Colonel Jim Corbett, who stalked legendary man-eaters through the silent darkness on opposite sides of the world; men like Karamojo Bell, acknowledged as the greatest elephant hunter of all time; men like the valiant Sasha Siemel, who tracked killer jaguars though the Matto Grosso armed only with a spear. With an authenticity gained by having shared the experiences he writes of, Capstick eloquently recreates the acrid taste of terror in the mouth of a man whose gun has jammed as a lion begins his charge, the exhilaration of tracking and finding a long-sought prey, the bravery and even nobility of performing under circumstances of primitive and savage stress, with death all around in the silent places of the wilderness.",['Peter Hathaway Capstick'],St. Martin's Press,1989,['Sports & Recreation'],1.0,5.0,1997-08-30,"Exciting, non-stop adventure from the master of the genre!","Peter Hathaway Capstick is without a doubt the author of the most exciting books on hunting in Africa (and around the world). *Death in the Silent Places* is one of his best books. Written in the terse, familiar style for which he is famous, the book covers the lives of several famous hunters. Capstick definitely has a feel for excitement; his retelling of Patterson's encounters at Tsavo was one of the most electrifying stories I have ever read. Capstick's prose will make you laugh with delight and cringe with terror--the only author I have ever read who makes you feel like you're right there with his subjects, holding your own 4-gauge elephant gun and sweating under the desert sun",6,6

The Awakening,"The Awakening, originally titled A Solitary Soul, is a novel by Kate Chopin, first published in 1899. Set in New Orleans and on the Louisiana Gulf coast at the end of the 19th century, the plot centers on Edna Pontellier and her struggle between her increasingly unorthodox views on femininity and motherhood with the prevailing social attitudes of the turn-of-the-century American South.",['Kate Chopin'],Lulu.com,2016,['Fiction'],94.0,5.0,2011-10-31,A classic on liberation of the soul,"The John Goodman character in ""Treme,"" a university professor despairing at the irreparable damage Katrina has done to the delicate web of New Orleans culture, talks at some length in a classroom scene about Kate Chopin's novel, emphasizing, if memory serves me, the impact of The Awakening on contemporary readers.The novel's theme of an individual woman's, or person's, ""awakening"" and self-realization are timeless. That its consequences in terms of her behavior were scandalous at the turn of the 20th century is interesting for the student of literature, but for us simple readers it is really more a question of how Edna Pontellier's change in attitude made it, in the end, impossible for her to live in the bourgeois society of New Orleans' upper class.I had gathered from the Goodman character's remarks in Treme that she was ostracized from society for her behavior, but it never comes to that. Her departure precedes a full-blown scandal.Even with this dark, brooding side, the novel is completely charming for the contemporary reader. The view of an exotic Creole society -- apparently Chopin's stock in trade for her contemporary readers -- is as enchanting now as then, perhaps more so because it has truly vanished.The vivid and lovely descriptions of summer on the Grand Isle and much of the life back in the city do transport the reader to another time and place. The author exploits her lush setting to the hilt: ""She went and stood at an open window and looked out upon the deep tangle of the garden below. All the mystery and witchery of the night seemed to have gathered there amid the perfumes and the dusky and tortuous outlines of flowers and foliage.""The view of Edna's inner life, the struggle there, are lyrically described: ""There were days when she was very happy without knowing why. She was happy to be alive and breathing, when her whole being seemed to be one with the sunlight, the color, the odors, the luxuriant warmth of some perfect Southern day. She liked then to wander alone into strange and unfamiliar places. She discovered many a sunny, sleepy corner, fashioned to dream in. And she found it good to dream and to be alone and unmolested.""Edna's husband is cold and detached, but not unsympathetic. When Edna, in an early sign of rebellion, refuses to come to bed but remains outside one evening, he plants himself possessively near her and smokes cigars until the chill drives her in. When she takes advantage of his extended business trip to move out of their house into a place of her own nearby, he immediately sends workmen into the abandoned house to begin a major renovation that offers an explanation for her move that avoids scandal.Edna's would-be lovers, Robert and Alcee, are young and callow. Her women friends reflect each one the complex motives roiling her soul -- except none betray the passion that Edna feels rising in her.A wry humor and gentle irony also ripple through the narrative. Mademoiselle Reisz, a spinster pianist with an enigmatic connection to Edna, is also a figure of fun with a bouquet of violets in her hair and a pile of cushions on her dinner seat.Edna's yearning for freedom is poignant. Other characters point out its childish and selfish nature, but that makes Edna no less sympathetic to the reader. In the end, her inability to reconcile her awakening with her society is immeasurably sad.",0,0

The Birthday Boys,"A brilliantly realized evocation of the thoughts and voices of Captain Scott and the four men with him, who suffered extraordinary hardships before finally dying during their 1912 attempt to be the first to reach the South Pole. 'Bainbridge's account of the horribly familiar story is both fresh and sure-footed. The power of her imagination, her clarity of expression and mastery of language are more striking than anything else I have read this year' Jane Shilling, Sunday Telegraph The Birthday Boys is one of Beryl Bainbridge's most acclaimed novels, telling the story of Scott's doomed expedition through the voices of five men on the voyage. As Scott, Petty Officer Taff Evans, ship's doctor Dr Edward Wilson, Lieutenant Henry Bowers and Captain Lawrence Oates step forward for their place in the narrative, the reader is gripped by the the characters themselves alongside the vividly evoked period.",['Beryl Bainbridge'],Hachette UK,2010,['Fiction'],7.0,4.0,1999-08-14,I may be some time,"A wonderful tale of heroism and incompetence. Scott and his men are refugees from the Victorian era, still clinging to what were, by 1911, slightly outdated notions of heroism. We are in the dying years of the Empire, the last days of the era before telecommunications and airplanes made this sort of adventure almost impossible. Scott is a brave, loyal leader of his men, but he is a poor leader for such an expedition - he is alternately too stubborn and too indecisive. Scott is the book's most sympathetic figure, but also the most stupid as he leads four brave men to their deaths. If the expedition had been led by Oates, Bainbridge's cold, ruthless villain, one feels it might have had a happier ending - yet who would care about the men who came second if they had survived and lived to be 80? Bainbridge gets into the heads of these men and charts their mental and physical voyages from hope to their inevitable destiny in snowy graves. It is often easy to forget that we are reading the words of a woman born in the 1930s rather than the actual words of Wilson, Scott and the other men. Her feel for the extraordinary beauty and violence of the Antarctic is one of the books many strengths. As in her Titanic book Bainbridge paints a convincing picture of those few eventful years between the death of Victoria and the start of World War 1, when the world was overtaking the Empire and Britain and her citizens were struggling to assert themselves in quite the way they had in the previous century.",0,0

Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed,"In Jared Diamond’s follow-up to the Pulitzer-Prize winning Guns, Germs and Steel, the author explores how climate change, the population explosion and political discord create the conditions for the collapse of civilization. Diamond is also the author of Upheaval: Turning Points for Nations in Crisis Environmental damage, climate change, globalization, rapid population growth, and unwise political choices were all factors in the demise of societies around the world, but some found solutions and persisted. As in Guns, Germs, and Steel, Diamond traces the fundamental pattern of catastrophe, and weaves an all-encompassing global thesis through a series of fascinating historical-cultural narratives. Collapse moves from the Polynesian cultures on Easter Island to the flourishing American civilizations of the Anasazi and the Maya and finally to the doomed Viking colony on Greenland. Similar problems face us today and have already brought disaster to Rwanda and Haiti, even as China and Australia are trying to cope in innovative ways. Despite our own society’s apparently inexhaustible wealth and unrivaled political power, ominous warning signs have begun to emerge even in ecologically robust areas like Montana.

THE CATCHER IN THE RYE,"Anyone who has read J. D. Salinger's New Yorker stories - particularly A Perfect Day for Bananafish, Uncle Wiggily in Connecticut, The Laughing Man, and For Esme - With Love and Squalor, will not be surprised by the fact that his first novel is full of children. The hero-narrator of The Catcher in the Rye is an ancient child of sixteen, a native New Yorker named Holden Caulfield. Through circumstances that tend to preclude adult, secondhand description, he leaves his prep school in Pennsylvania and goes underground in New York City for three days. The boy himself is at once too simple and too complex for us to make any final comment about him or his story. Perhaps the safest thing we can say about Holden is that he was born in the world not just strongly attracted to beauty but, almost, hopelessly impaled on it. There are many voices in this novel: children's voices, adult voices, underground voices-but Holden's voice is the most eloquent of all. Transcending his own vernacular, yet remaining marvelously faithful to it, he issues a perfectly articulated cry of mixed pain and pleasure. However, like most lovers and clowns and poets of the higher orders, he keeps most of the pain to, and for, himself. The pleasure he gives away, or sets aside, with all his heart. It is there for the reader who can handle it to keep.",['J.D. Salinger'],"Little, Brown",1951,['Fiction'],3179.0,2.0,2001-04-27,have read better,"I read this book because I had to.

But it was this year the same as last year, I didn't really like the book that much. I found the language difficult to read, it is probably spoken language, because he says all the time &quot;...and all&quot;. The story however is good. It's about a 16-year old boy, Holden Cauldfield, who gets kicked out of school. He wants to leave school but doesn't want to go directly to his parents. He's afraid os their reaction, especially his mother's, who would probably freak out. All the things that happen between him leaving school and returning home are also likely to happen in real life. But I kind of hated the main character. I don't like the jargon he uses and he's always saying the same kind of things, like &quot;really I'm not kidding&quot;, I can't stand that. However, it is possible that people recognise themselves in Holden, he is looking for himself, he's not sure who he is, and he may have things in common with some teenagers, but not with me. He is always depressed and I really don't like to read depressing books.",0,1

The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich,"National Book Award Winner: The definitive account of Nazi Germany and “one of the most important works of history of our time” (The New York Times). When the Third Reich fell, it fell swiftly. The Nazis had little time to destroy their memos, their letters, or their diaries. William L. Shirer’s sweeping account of the Third Reich uses these unique sources, combined with his experience living in Germany as an international correspondent throughout the war. The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich earned Shirer a National Book Award and continues to be recognized as one of the most important and authoritative books about the Third Reich and Nazi Germany ever written. The diaries of propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels, as well as evidence and other testimony gained at the Nuremberg Trials, could not have found more artful hands. Shirer gives a clear, detailed, and well-documented account of how it was that Adolf Hitler almost succeeded in conquering the world.

Along such, the author ""prescribed"" : ""Burn it into memory. Wake up each morning and ask yourself, ""What am I going to do today to close the gap between what I am doing and what really matters most to me?""""

We think that by simply setting out a few vague goals, behavior changes will miraculously happen. Setting goals is important and necessary, but it's not the place to begin. My suggestion is that you delay writing resolutions until you have identified your governing values, those things in life that matter most to you, those things without which you would find life meaningless or unfulfilling, those things that lie at heart of who you are and who you hope to become.Pg 150: The most effective tool I have discovered in whipping the demons is to have regular victories in my life every single day. When you do something right, take a moment and savor the feeling. Even a little victory does wonders for your confidence and motivation. Make a conscious effort to successfully complete some task each day related to something that really matters to you. That'll help keep the demons at bay.Pg 151: There are many types of diseases that afflict the human body, and we spend millions and perhaps billions of dollars trying to find cures. But there is one disease of epidemic proportions in our society on which we spend little or no money or effort - the crippling disease called fear of failure.Pg 153: There is a wonderful story about a very successful entrepreneur who was asked why he was so successful. His response was ""Good decisions."" The second question was ""Well, how do you make good decisions?"" The response,: ""Experience."" And then the final question: ""How do you get experience?""

Lord of the flies,"William Golding’s unforgettable classic of boyhood adventure and the savagery of humanity comes to Penguin Classics in a stunning Graphic Deluxe Edition with a new foreword by Lois Lowry As provocative today as when it was first published in 1954, Lord of the Flies continues to ignite passionate debate with its startling, brutal portrait of human nature. William Golding’s compelling story about a group of very ordinary boys marooned on a coral island has been labeled a parable, an allegory, a myth, a morality tale, a parody, a political treatise, and even a vision of the apocalypse. But above all, it has earned its place as one of the indisputable classics of the twentieth century for readers of any age. This Penguin Classics Graphic Deluxe Edition features an array of special features to supplement the novel, including a foreword by Lois Lowry, an introduction by Stephen King, an essay by E. M. Forster, an essay on teaching and reading the novel and suggestions for further exploration by scholar Jennifer Buehler, and an extended note by E. L.

As they did this across multiple incarnations they started to develop those animal appendages in their physical bodies.It was in ancient Egypt around 10,500 BC that the priest Ra Ta and other Atlanteans helped these ""things"" to rid themselves of these animal characteristics.That ""mystery of mysteries"" the sphinx is a creature that is part human and part lion. Don't think this doesn't have some very deep and hidden meaning.Another key point in the book is the death of Socrates.

Before long, the ""Green River Killer"" would be suspected in at least forty-nine more homicides, with no end in sight. Then the authorities received an unbelievable letter from the infamous serial killer Ted Bundy -- then on Florida's death row -- offering to help catch the Green River Killer. But he would only talk to one man: Robert Keppel, the former homicide detective who had helped track Bundy's cross-county killing spree. Now these conversations are revealed, in which Bundy speculates about the motive and methods of the Green River Killer -- and reveals his own twisted secrets as well. Now, as never before, we look into the face of evil...and into the heart of a killer.",['Robert Keppel'],Simon and Schuster,2010,['True Crime'],3.0,5.0,2000-06-29,Reveals the true evil of Ted Bundy,"If you are a fan of true crime books, then you will, of course, have heard the names Bob Keppel and Ted Bundy. You will know that Ted Bundy was a sadistic serial killer whose cruelty knew no bounds, and you will know that Bob Keppel is the dedicated homicide investigator who initially spent half a decade hunting Bundy, and who, later in his brilliant career, spent many years tracking an even more elusive quarry than Ted - the Green River Killer, who, needless to say, has avoided capture to this day.Keppel draws the reader into both of these investigations in an excellent fashion, as his writing abilities more than equal his detective skills. You will feel as though you are ploughing through the underbrush beside the volunteers in Issaquah and Taylor Mountain, searching for the remains of Bundy's innocent victims. You will feel his frustration at not being able to bring the Green River Killer to justice, and finally, you will sit beside him as he hears the final confessions of Ted Bundy, who revealed to Keppel the horrible truth about his sadistic perversions in the hope of winning a stay of execution, in the process exploiting his victims and their families once again.I can't recommend this book enough. We all criticise homicide detectives for not being able to solve all the appalling murders that are thrown their way, and here, Keppel describes the sheer persistance and hard work that these investigators put into their jobs, and how they receive very little in the way of rewards or credit as a result. The details of the Bundy and Green River investigations show Keppel as a fine, sympathetic human being - he seems torn between a detective's need for answers and the true revulsion he feels when he finally obtains them, especially when he is hearing, at long last and after so many years, Ted Bundy's descriptions of how he committed some of his numerous murders. You will wish that there were more hours in the day to read this book, and undoubtedly, you will read it during the day with all the doors and windows locked and the lights switched on!",16,18

After reading it, I'm not really sure why. Maybe because these ""Dogs for Dummies"" books are plastered all over pet stores, so a lot of people buy them. I found the book to be extremely hard to follow, with no sensible flow. Granted, there are good points in the book, and a lot of the suggestions worked, and so I'm giving this book 3 stars instead of 1 or 2. I really wish this book were organized in terms of age of the puppy. It would've been helpful to have a large chapter dedicated solely to the first two weeks. Instead, there are bits and pieces of information regarding the first few very important weeks scattered through each chapter, under different headings. There are so many references to other chapters and pages, that I now have (ironically) dog-eared pages all over the place.That being said, I'm now going to try out ""The Art of Raising a Puppy"", which some friends who have raised numerous dogs (including K-9 unit service dogs) highly recommended as ""the best puppy book on the market"".",2,2

Systematic theology,"This new printing of Louis Berkhof's classic Systematic Theology represents a publishing landmark. For the first time in its long and acclaimed history, Berkhof's monumental treatment of the doctrines of the Reformed faith is now available together in one volume with Introduction to the Study of Systematic Theology, Berkhof's formal prolegomenon to his theology. Meant to be read together with Systematic Theology, the Introduction includes Berkhof's discussions of the nature and character of dogmatics, the methods and history of theological system, and the principia, or foundations, of theology - Scripture and God. This edition also includes a new preface by Richard A. Muller that explains both the publishing history and the relation and importance of the Introduction to the rest of Berkhof's text. Written in a concise and compact style and organized in a manner ideal for detailed study, Systematic Theology covers the full range of theology in traditional systematic fashion - examining, in order, the doctrines of God, anthropology, Christology, soteriology, ecclesiology, and eschatology. The work also includes an extensive bibliography and full indexes to the authors, subjects, and Scriptures referenced in the text. Revised and enlarged throughout his lifetime until it reached its present final form, Systematic Theology not only stands as Berkhof's magnum opus but also is widely considered to be the most important twentieth-century compendium of Reformed theology.",['Louis Berkhof'],Wm.

Yes, there is far too much interaction with the pseudo-science of the day, but this &quot;abridgement&quot; lays waste to whole areas of interest to anyone who would want to read Hodge in the first place. It's interesting that one of the areas where the cutting is most obvious is in the area where the &quot;editor&quot; disagrees with Hodge the most, that is the locus of &quot;eschatology&quot;. The editor is a Premillennialist and Hodge, like all Princetonians was a clear Postmillennialist. If you want to read Hodge without the excess verbiage, buy A.A Hodge's &quot;Outlines of Theology&quot;, which is based on the very same lectures that Charles Hodge published as his Systematics. It's simpler, yet doesn't alter the truth the way this chopped-up mess does. This abridgement is a master maligned.",37,44

Lost River has been recommended to him as an ideal place to go, so he packs up, and heads down there, thinking he'll just be there for the winter. But as time goes on, Oswald falls in love with the little town, and all it's residence, including one very special redbird, Jack, and one precious little girl, Patsy.Of course I absolutely recommend this book for people of all ages, it's such a sweet Christmas story that I can't give enough praise to.

Queen of Camelot,"Return to a time of legend—the days of Guinevere and Arthur and the glory that was to become Camelot On the night of Guinevere’s birth, a wise woman declares a prophecy of doom for the child: She will be gwenhwyfar, the white shadow, destined to betray her king, and be herself betrayed. Years pass, and Guinevere becomes a great beauty, riding free across Northern Wales on her beloved horse. She is entranced by the tales of the valorous Arthur, a courageous warrior who seems to Guinevere no mere man, but a legend. Then she finds herself betrothed to that same famous king, a hero who commands her willing devotion. Just as his knights and all his subjects, she falls under Arthur’s spell. At the side of King Arthur, Guinevere reigns strong and true. Yet she soon learns how the dark prophecy will reveal itself. She is unable to conceive. Arthur’s only true heir is Mordred, offspring of a cursed encounter with the witch Morgause.

Yes, it's that old Jordan whine: &quot;Why can't he finish it already?&quot; I know others have said it, but I think it's really disappointing that such a promising series (up to Book 4) has been allowed to deteriorate in quality to this extent, in a money-making exercise.Some of the other reviewers here have stated that Jordan's incredible detail (read: lack of resolution) qualify him as one of the greatest fantasy writers, etc etc. I have to give him credit for his meticulous working through of plot, setting, etc. However, I believe that all of this is rather pointless because the bottom line is that his books are becoming boring. Boring, you don't read it. What's the point, then, of writing it if it bores the reader? There are few things more futile than an unread book.Another oft-repeated plea: please, please, PLEASE read George R. R. Martin rather than this crap. Seriously, his style is similar to Jordan's: multiple point-of-view, epic scale, relatively formal register. However his characters are real, he isn't afraid to break the rules (pivotal characters die!) and I don't want to murder EVERY SINGLE FREAKIN' ONE OF THE CHARACTERS!Plus, as a special introductory offer, you DON'T get incessant whinings about how men/women are emotionally/intellectually stupid/incomprehensible...the number-one cause of Jordan Rage in my household.",28,39
Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance : An Inquiry Into Values,"THE CLASSIC BOOK THAT HAS INSPIRED MILLIONS A penetrating examination of how we live and how to live better Few books transform a generation and then establish themselves as touchstones for the generations that follow. Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance is one such book. This modern epic of a man’s search for meaning became an instant bestseller on publication in 1974, acclaimed as one of the most exciting books in the history of American letters. It continues to inspire millions. A narration of a summer motorcycle trip undertaken by a father and his son, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance becomes a personal and philosophical odyssey into fundamental questions on how to live.

There have been so many plot lines intorduced and so many loose ends exposed that I really think it is about time Jordan started tying a few of them up. It really is beginning to look as if the series will just go on forever now, and the monotony of reading them now is beginning to make the entire series seem like just a marketing ploy to keep people buying books indefinitely until they die. If you think the series will end with Jordan's death, think again. They did it with James Bond, they can find another writer, some protoge' of Jordan's, to pick up the series with very little effort at all.I may stop reading sometime in the middle of this book.

The Lost Painting: The Quest for a Caravaggio Masterpiece,"Told with consummate skill by the writer of the bestselling, award-winning A Civil Action, The Lost Painting is a remarkable synthesis of history and detective story. An Italian village on a hilltop near the Adriatic coast, a decaying palazzo facing the sea, and in the basement, cobwebbed and dusty, lit by a single bulb, an archive unknown to scholars. Here, a young graduate student from Rome, Francesca Cappelletti, makes a discovery that inspires a search for a work of art of incalculable value, a painting lost for almost two centuries. The artist was Caravaggio, a master of the Italian Baroque. He was a genius, a revolutionary painter, and a man beset by personal demons. Four hundred years ago, he drank and brawled in the taverns and streets of Rome, moving from one rooming house to another, constantly in and out of jail, all the while painting works of transcendent emotional and visual power. He rose from obscurity to fame and wealth, but success didn’t alter his violent temperament. His rage finally led him to commit murder, forcing him to flee Rome a hunted man. He died young, alone, and under strange circumstances. Caravaggio scholars estimate that between sixty and eighty of his works are in existence today. Many others–no one knows the precise number–have been lost to time. Somewhere, surely, a masterpiece lies forgotten in a storeroom, or in a small parish church, or hanging above a fireplace, mistaken for a mere copy. Prizewinning author Jonathan Harr embarks on an spellbinding journey to discover the long-lost painting known as The Taking of Christ–its mysterious fate and the circumstances of its disappearance have captivated Caravaggio devotees for years. After Francesca Cappelletti stumbles across a clue in that dusty archive, she tracks the painting across a continent and hundreds of years of history. But it is not until she meets Sergio Benedetti, an art restorer working in Ireland, that she finally manages to assemble all the pieces of the puzzle. Praise for The Lost Painting “Jonathan Harr has gone to the trouble of writing what will probably be a bestseller . . . rich and wonderful. . . . In truth, the book reads better than a thriller. . . . If you're a sucker for Rome, and for dusk . . . [you'll] enjoy Harr's more clearly reported details about life in the city.”—The New York Times Book Review “Jonathan Harr has taken the story of the lost painting, and woven from it a deeply moving narrative about history, art and taste—and about the greed, envy, covetousness and professional jealousy of people who fall prey to obsession. It is as perfect a work of narrative nonfiction as you could ever hope to read.”—The Economist",['Jonathan Harr'],Random House Trade Paperbacks,2006,['Art'],32.0,4.0,2005-11-03,a captivating read,"Not having read Jonathan Harr's previous book, (""A Civil Action"") I'm unable to comment on which is the better book; what I can say, though, was that I was totally captivated by ""The Lost Painting.""Many scholars acknowledge that there probably are several missing Caravaggio masterpieces lying about forgotten and neglected. ""The Lost Painting"" is about the search for and discover of one such painting, ""The Taking Of Christ."" In 1989, while working on a project, graduate students, Francesca Cappelletti and Laura Testa, come across mention of the sale of ""The Taking of Christ"" in the early part of the nineteenth century by the then owner, Guisseppe Mattei to a Scotsman. The information fires up in Francesca a desire to discover what happened to the painting from this point on. She is only partially successful. In the meantime, art restorer, Sergio Benedetti, makes an astonishing discovery when a routine job nets an inexpected find...Jonathan Harr did, I thought, a wonderful job of vividly conveying the excitement and drive of those involved in the search for (Francesca Cappelletti) and discovery of Caravaggio's lost painting (Sergio Benedetti). And if the author sometimes sounded a little detached and removed from what he was relating in the book, he more than made up for it with his clear and precise descriptions of scenes and characters -- I thought that his portrayal of the slightly gaga Marchesa was priceless; and really enjoyed his brief but telling descriptions of all the characters, both primary and secondary. My sole reservation lay in what I thought was the unnecessary inclusion of Francesca's private romantic life into the book. It struck a slightly jarring note, I thought. Fortunately, this was far and few between. I was also disappointed that neither the author not his editors thought to include picture plates of some of the paintings discussed in the book. It would have been nice to have had easy access to the Doria Pamphili ""St. John,"" the Capitoline ""St. John"" and esp ""The Taking of Christ"" without having to unearth my old art history books, still in boxes. Oh well, at least it inspired me to put up more bookshelves and unpack all those boxes of books! All in all, though, ""The Lost Painting"" was a completely riveting and enthralling read, and one I would especially recommend to art lovers everywhere.",105,110
"All the Centurions: A New York City Cop Remembers His Years on the Street, 1961-1981","The bestselling book and acclaimed film Prince of the City told only part of Robert Leuci's story. In All the Centurions, he shares the full account of his years as a narcotics detective with the New York Police Department -- a tale of daring adventure, shattered illusions, and finally, astonishing spiritual growth. Leuci reminisces about cops both celebrated and notorious, like Frank Serpico, Sonny Grosso, and Frank King from the French Connection case. Also here are politicians, Mafia figures, corrupt defense lawyers, and district attorneys, including a young Rudolph Giuliani. Leuci reveals the dark side of the criminal justice system: the bitterness, greed, cruelty, and ambition that eventually overflowed into the streets, precinct houses, and courtrooms of the city. As vivid and entertaining as the best crime novels, All the Centurions is the story of a man descending into a hell of his own making who ultimately finds his way out through truth and justice.",['Robert Leuci'],Harper Collins,2009,['Political Science'],1.0,5.0,2004-07-24,Powerful Revelations,"The revelations in this book are not diluted by the distance of three decades. Rampant graft, dirty cops, obscene rationalizations and the grim necessity of fighting scum all play a part in this unflinching look at the reality of New York's war on drugs during the 60s and 70s. The author is painfully candid about his faults and his participation--he was corrupt and is not shy about saying so.Now the author offers unique insight into how it happened, and in telling it, shows by example how we can prevent repetition of history. The author is at his strongest when blunt and forthcoming in his endearingly dry tone. He refrains from opining and offering simplistic answers or steps to prevent such events from continuing to happen in departments across the country--and in refraining, his statement is that much stronger.A piece of American history told in brisk, compelling style.

Ever Wonder What it Would Be Like to Live Homeless? Mike Yankoski did more than just wonder. By his own choice, Mike's life went from upper-middle class plush to scum-of-the-earth repulsive overnight. With only a backpack, a sleeping bag and a guitar, Mike and his traveling companion, Sam, set out to experience life on the streets in six different cities—from Washington D.C. to San Diego— and they put themselves to the test. For more than five months the pair experienced firsthand the extreme pains of hunger, the constant uncertainty and danger of living on the streets, exhaustion, depression, and social rejection—and all of this by their own choice. They wanted to find out if their faith was real, if they could actually be the Christians they said they were apart from the comforts they’d always known…to discover first hand what it means to be homeless in America. What you encounter in these pages will radically alter how you see your world—and may even change your life.",['Mike Yankoski'],Multnomah,2009,['Religion'],64.0,4.0,2011-03-02,The Homeless are Human,"I recently read an interesting and provocative book, Under the Overpass: A Journey of Faith on the Streets of America by Mike Yankoski. In the summer and fall of 2003, Yankoski and his friend Sam Purvis spent five months living homeless on the streets of major American cities. Under the Overpass is a series of snapshots of their five months living among the forgotten and despised.During their time on the streets they slept in rescue missions and on street grates. They encountered drug addicts, mentally ill veterans, and teenage runaways. Fast-food employees, shoppers, and church-goers treated them with varying degrees of contempt. Yet in the midst of being ignored and treated as invisible were unexpected moments of grace. It was in these brief and infrequent encounters, when they were seen and respected as human beings, that Yankoski and Purvis found the presence of Christ most clearly. Beyond the physical suffering and material privation of homelessness they discovered the deepest of human needs: to be seen, engaged with dignity, and loved.Under the Overpass is a call to live our lives mindful of the many around us who are unseen and forgotten, living with pain and without hope. Reflecting on their experience of homelessness, Sam Purvis says, ""I think loving God is supposed to push all of us to be immersed in our world."" I find it easy to disengage from the world rather than immerse myself in it. This book pushed me to open my eyes and heart to the people around me and to engage them with respect and the love of Christ.I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review.",0,0

For her first book, Morrison managed to incorporate the elements of race and gender injustices and wove it with the reality of social stratification during that era for an unforgettable story. Pecola Breedlove is the tortured main character whose life is peppered with the pressures of falling short of the glory and the repercussions of being on the cusp of society's sometimes cruel and unforgiving standards of beauty. Morrison successfully takes the reader on a journey through the lives of her characters using metaphors, similes, foreshadowing and language that is difficult to forget. It's a fantastic read and my favorite novel to date.",1,2

It is a tale of love and danger, of triumph at an unthinkable cost -- a magnificent portrait of a people divided by class, faith, and prejudice -- an unforgettable saga of the fires that devastated a majestic land . . . and the unquenchable flames that burn in the human heart.",['Leon Uris'],Harper Collins,2006,['Fiction'],23.0,5.0,2000-03-20,Trinity,"Trinity gives an exciting account of the Irish struggle for independence while giving historical context.

When Philip Gulley began writing newsletter essays for the twelve members of his Quaker meeting in Indiana, he had no idea one of them would find its way to radio commentator Paul Harvey Jr. and be read on the air to 24 million people.

Darkfever (Fever Series),"MacKayla Lane’s life is good. She has great friends, a decent job, and a car that breaks down only every other week or so. In other words, she’s your perfectly ordinary twenty-first-century woman. Or so she thinks . . . until something extraordinary happens. When her sister is murdered, leaving a single clue to her death—a cryptic message on Mac’s cell phone—Mac journeys to Ireland in search of answers. The quest to find her sister’s killer draws her into a shadowy realm where nothing is as it seems, where good and evil wear the same treacherously seductive mask. She is soon faced with an even greater challenge: staying alive long enough to learn how to handle a power she had no idea she possessed–a gift that allows her to see beyond the world of man, into the dangerous realm of the Fae. . . . As Mac delves deeper into the mystery of her sister’s death, her every move is shadowed by the dark, mysterious Jericho, a man with no past and only mockery for a future. As she begins to close in on the truth, the ruthless Vlane—an alpha Fae who makes sex an addiction for human women–closes in on her. And as the boundary between worlds begins to crumble, Mac’s true mission becomes clear: find the elusive Sinsar Dubh before someone else claims the all-powerful Dark Book—because whoever gets to it first holds nothing less than complete control of the very fabric of both worlds in their hands. . . .

The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA,"The classic personal account of Watson and Crick’s groundbreaking discovery of the structure of DNA, now with an introduction by Sylvia Nasar, author of A Beautiful Mind. By identifying the structure of DNA, the molecule of life, Francis Crick and James Watson revolutionized biochemistry and won themselves a Nobel Prize. At the time, Watson was only twenty-four, a young scientist hungry to make his mark. His uncompromisingly honest account of the heady days of their thrilling sprint against other world-class researchers to solve one of science’s greatest mysteries gives a dazzlingly clear picture of a world of brilliant scientists with great gifts, very human ambitions, and bitter rivalries. With humility unspoiled by false modesty, Watson relates his and Crick’s desperate efforts to beat Linus Pauling to the Holy Grail of life sciences, the identification of the basic building block of life. Never has a scientist been so truthful in capturing in words the flavor of his work.",['James D.

Under the Banner of Heaven: A Story of Violent Faith,"NATIONAL BESTSELLER • From the author of Into the Wild and Into Thin Air, this extraordinary work of investigative journalism takes readers inside America’s isolated Mormon Fundamentalist communities. Defying both civil authorities and the Mormon establishment in Salt Lake City, the renegade leaders of these Taliban-like theocracies are zealots who answer only to God; some 40,000 people still practice polygamy in these communities. At the core of Krakauer’s book are brothers Ron and Dan Lafferty, who insist they received a commandment from God to kill a blameless woman and her baby girl. Beginning with a meticulously researched account of this appalling double murder, Krakauer constructs a multi-layered, bone-chilling narrative of messianic delusion, polygamy, savage violence, and unyielding faith. Along the way he uncovers a shadowy offshoot of America’s fastest growing religion, and raises provocative questions about the nature of religious belief.",['Jon Krakauer'],Anchor,2004,['True Crime'],35.0,5.0,2003-12-30,More than a murder story,"This book was initially picked up because it dealt with a murder that took place under the guise of the Mormon religion.

As a person who questions the validity of the Mormon religion -- I look at it as more of a cult than anything else, it was an indepth study of how the church was started (by a person who was essentially a scam artist), how it progressed and now how it is trying to rewrite its history.

Abundance: A Novel of Marie Antoinette,"Marie Antoinette was a child of fourteen when her mother, the Empress of Austria, arranged for her to leave her family and her country to become the wife of the fifteen-year-old Dauphin, the future King of France. Coming of age in the most public of arenas—eager to be a good wife and strong queen—she warmly embraces her adopted nation and its citizens. She shows her new husband nothing but love and encouragement, though he repeatedly fails to consummate their marriage and in so doing is unable to give what she and the people of France desire most: a child and an heir to the throne. Deeply disappointed and isolated in her own intimate circle, and apart from the social life of the court, she allows herself to remain ignorant of the country's growing economic and political crises, even as poor harvests, bitter winters, war debts, and poverty precipitate rebellion and revenge. The young queen, once beloved by the common folk, becomes a target of scorn, cruelty, and hatred as she, the court's nobles, and the rest of the royal family are caught up in the nightmarish violence of a murderous time called ""the Terror."" With penetrating insight and with wondrous narrative skill, Sena Jeter Naslund offers an intimate, fresh, heartbreaking, and dramatic reimagining of this truly compelling woman that goes far beyond popular myth—and she makes a bygone time of tumultuous change as real to us as the one we are living in now.",['Sena Jeter Naslund'],Harper Collins,2009,['Fiction'],37.0,5.0,2007-07-18,Descriptive and Beautiful writing,"I just wanted to leave a note that I absolutely love this story, and recommend it to anyone intrigued by Marie Antionette and anyone who loves incredibly descriptive writing.

Jane is unlike other girls, she describes herself as plain and boring and after leaving Lowood, she decides to take on the job of governess at Thornfield Hall.This brief synopsis is all that happens during the first part of the novel, but after this, Bronte creates a story that is mesmerizing and full of intriguing symbolism and a surprise plot twist at the end that was completely unexpected. I loved Bronte's play on names: Jane Eyre, Helen Burns, Mrs. Fairfax, Thornfield Hall, etc. The scenes between Jane and Mr. Rochester are at once heartbreaking and romantic, including my favorite scene in the garden (the details of which I will not give away).It's easy to be tempted to give up on 'Jane Eyre' because of the slow beginning, but once Jane begins her job as governess, the novel comes alive as Bronte weaves the intricate plot that is full of joy, sorrow and bizarre occurrances.",4,4
Economics in one lesson (Pocket book),"With over a million copies sold, Economics in One Lesson is an essential guide to the basics of economic theory. A fundamental influence on modern libertarianism, Hazlitt defends capitalism and the free market from economic myths that persist to this day. Considered among the leading economic thinkers of the “Austrian School,” which includes Carl Menger, Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich (F.A.) Hayek, and others, Henry Hazlitt (1894-1993), was a libertarian philosopher, an economist, and a journalist. He was the founding vice-president of the Foundation for Economic Education and an early editor of The Freeman magazine, an influential libertarian publication. Hazlitt wrote Economics in One Lesson, his seminal work, in 1946. Concise and instructive, it is also deceptively prescient and far-reaching in its efforts to dissemble economic fallacies that are so prevalent they have almost become a new orthodoxy. Economic commentators across the political spectrum have credited Hazlitt with foreseeing the collapse of the global economy which occurred more than 50 years after the initial publication of Economics in One Lesson. Hazlitt’s focus on non-governmental solutions, strong — and strongly reasoned — anti-deficit position, and general emphasis on free markets, economic liberty of individuals, and the dangers of government intervention make Economics in One Lesson every bit as relevant and valuable today as it has been since publication.",['Henry Hazlitt'],Currency,2010,['Business & Economics'],18.0,5.0,2011-12-18,A must-read for any presidential candidate,"This books sheds light on our contemporary issue of big government whose spending has drained our economy.

I struggled to read this book. Whereas I normally read a Linda Howard book in one sitting, this took me about two weeks! That's right, TWO WEEKS. I actually skimmed through the beginning of the book as all the talk about viruses, etc. was too detailed...and boring. It just dragged on and on. Also, I'm not a fan of books that are supposed to be romantic suspenses, yet the main couple doesn't even meet until a third to halfway through the book (this is the main reason I also didn't care for her book ""Son of the Morning""). I don't see how they are supposed to be in love by the end. While the hero was okay, one of the things bothersome about him is that he had two children that he just walked away from. I don't care if he did still support them (bully for him), it makes it hard to believe he wouldn't walk away in the future from Lili. And also, **Spoiler Alert** he had a vesectomy, and Lili is 37 years old. One of the purposes of romance books is to believe that the couple will have a happy ending. Well, would he try to have the vasectomy reversed? Lili obviously likes children, does she want any of their own? These are just some of the things that left me...unfulfilled, I guess. I didn't walk away feeling like they had a happy ending because it was truly rushed at the end. Although I will still read her books, I will buy them used. And this one isn't a keeper on my bookshelf. Which is really disappointing. Hopefully her next one will be up to par.",16,20

A ground-breaking work in its time, The Forest People made him one of the most famous intellectuals of the 1960s and 1970s.

The Measure of a Mountain: Beauty and Terror on Mount Rainier,"In The Measure of a Mountain, Seattle writer Bruce Barcott sets out to know Rainier. His method is exploratory, meandering, personal. He begins by encircling it, first by car then on foot. He finds that the mountain is a complex of moss-bearded hemlocks and old-growth firs, high meadows that blossom according to a precise natural timeclock, sheets of crumbling pumice, fractured glaciers, and unsteady magma. Its snow fields bristle with bug life, and its marmots chew rocks to keep their teeth from overgrowing. Rainier rumbles with seismic twitches and jerks—some one-hundred-thirty earthquakes annually. The nightmare among geologists is the unstoppable wall of mud that will come rolling down its slopes when a hunk of mountain falls off, as it does every half century (and we’re fifty years overdue). Rainier is both an obsession and a temple that attracts its own passionate acolytes: scientists, priests, rangers, and mountain guides. Rainier is also a monument to death: every year someone manages just to disappear on its flanks; imperiled climbers and their rescuers perish on glaciers; a planeload of Marines remains lodged in ice since they crashed into the mountain in 1946. Referred to by locals as simply ""the mountain,"" it is the single largest feature of the Pacific Northwest landscape—provided it isn’t hidden in clouds. Visible or not, though, it’s presence is undeniable.",['Bruce Barcott'],Sasquatch Books,2011,['Nature'],4.0,5.0,2010-01-24,It's about The Mountain,"The Measure of a Mountain is a mountain climber's book in the same way that Edward Abbey's books are for the desert explorer, it is about the relationship with The Mountain not the climb. Bruce Barcott writes in a way that captures howy we in the Northwest engage with Mt. Rainier. There is something about it that draws us back, renews us, and then pushes us away. The Measure of a Mountain captures this like no other book, video, or film I have ever seen or read does.I often say that a climb of Mt. Rainier starts when you decide to make the ascent and includes the training, preparation, and psychological fitness that precedes a climb. This is the story of his preparation. Part of this time before the climb is getting to know yourself and understanding the challenge you have taken on. Mr. Barcott does this by analyzing, studying, presenting, and hiking around Mt. Rainier. The Mountain is none to kind to him in the process, anyone who has been to its flanks more than a time or two will truly understand. I love the end of the fourth chapter where he says ""At Mowich Lake, four days into the journey, I quit the mountain. The inexorable moist had crept into the cells of my sleeping bag.....I retired for the winter, beaten."" I had been there too.This is the book to read when preparing for Mt. Rainier, not so you can self-arrest or tie a good figure-8 but so you can understand what you are doing. A must-read for anyone who approaches the grand lady of the Northwest.",3,3

When a game of seduction between a husband and wife ends in death, the nightmare has only begun… “And now the voice which spoke belonged to no one but herself. Oh my God, it said. Oh my God, I am all alone out here. I am all alone.” Once again, Jessie Burlingame has been talked into submitting to her husband Gerald’s kinky sex games—something that she’s frankly had enough of, and they never held much charm for her to begin with. So much for a “romantic getaway” at their secluded summer home. After Jessie is handcuffed to the bedposts—and Gerald crosses a line with his wife—the day ends with deadly consequences. Now Jessie is utterly trapped in an isolated lakeside house that has become her prison—and comes face-to-face with her deepest, darkest fears and memories.

The Rage and the Pride,"With The Rage and the Pride Oriana Fallaci breaks a ten year silence. The silence she kept until September 11's apocalypse in her Manhattan house. She breaks it with a deafening noise. In Europe this book has caused and causes a turmoil never registered in decades. Polemics, discussion, debates, hearty consents and praises, wild attacks. And a million copies sold in Italy where it still is at the bestsellers' top. Hundreds of thousands in France, in Germany, in Spain: the other countries where it has become the Number one Bestseller. Around a dozen translations will soon appear. With her well-known courage Oriana Fallaci faces the themes unchained by the Islamic terrorism: the contrast and, in her opinion, incompatibility between the Islamic world and the Western world; the global reality of the Jihad and the lack of response, the lenience of the West. With her brutal sincerity she hurls pitiless accusations, vehement invectives, and denounces the uncomfortable truths that all of us know but never dare to express. With her rigorous logic, lucidity of mind, she defends our culture and blames what she calls our blindness, our deafness, our masochism, the conformism and the arrogance of the Politically Correct. With the poetry of a prophet like a modern Cassandra she says it in the form of a letter addressed to all of us. The text is enriched by a dramatic preface in which Oriana Fallaci reveals how The Rage and the Pride was born, grew up, and detachedly calls it ""my small book."" In addition, a preface in which she tells significant episodes of her extraordinary life and explains her unreachable isolation, her demanding and inflexible choices. Because of this too, what she calls ""my small book"" is in reality a great book. A precious book, a book that shakes our conscience. It is also the portrait of a soul. Her soul. No doubt it will remain as a thorn pierced inside our brains and our hearts.",['Oriana Fallaci'],Rizzoli International Publications,2002,['History'],3.0,4.0,2003-06-04,Fallaci Speaks Up,"Fallaci serious rants in this book.

Oh, excuse me, I must have fallen asleep over my copy of Shelters of Stone again.I felt almost obligated to read this book in spite of the bad press it's received because I read each of the four previous novels in this series. I didn't like Plains of Passage very much, but had high hopes that Shelters of Stone would recapture something of the feel of the first three books. Alas, Auel has presented us with a tedious doorstop of a book that in the end left me wondering why I bothered to work my way through the whole thing. The plot goes nowhere, there is little character development, and there is so much repetition of material that I found myself skimming pages more and more frequently as I progressed through the book. The whole thing is so badly edited and the conclusion is so abrupt that I was left with the impression that Auel walked away from her computer to get a cup of coffee and while she was gone someone transmitted the unpolished novel to the publisher without her knowledge.And the Mother's Song... Oh, the Mother's Song. What can I say that other reviewers haven't already said? It's one of the most outstanding terrible poems I've ever read, rivaling some of the stuff in ""Very Bad Poetry"" (edited by Ross and Kathryn Petras). Never mind the fact that it's repeated several times. One reading was more than enough to convince me that this is one of the worst poems ever written in the English language. It should be awarded prizes based on its sheer awfulness and the way it makes your hair stand on end when you read it.To be fair, I have to say that Shelters of Stone isn't ALL bad. I enjoy books that focus on social history, fiction or otherwise, so the descriptive passages about housing, hunting, and ritual that annoyed so many other reviewers were often interesting to me.In addition, I was delighted to discover that Ayla and/or Jondalar didn't invent the wheel, at least not yet. I've almost been expecting this to happen and was happy to be disappointed in this respect. I suppose there's not much time for inventing in a society where you spend two-thirds of your waking hours naming your ties to everyone you meet.In short, there is very little new information in this book. Auel takes 700+ pages to tell us that Ayla and Jondalar are mated, that their daughter is born, and that Ayla has decided to become One Who Serves. Sorry, Amazon.com, but I can't recommend that people purchase this one. If you're devoted to the series and feel that you must read it, check it out at your friendly neighborhood library and save yourself the purchase price.",7,7

Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking,"From the #1 bestselling author of The Bomber Mafia, the landmark book that has revolutionized the way we understand leadership and decision making. In his breakthrough bestseller The Tipping Point, Malcolm Gladwell redefined how we understand the world around us. Now, in Blink, he revolutionizes the way we understand the world within. Blink is a book about how we think without thinking, about choices that seem to be made in an instant--in the blink of an eye--that actually aren't as simple as they seem. Why are some people brilliant decision makers, while others are consistently inept? Why do some people follow their instincts and win, while others end up stumbling into error? How do our brains really work--in the office, in the classroom, in the kitchen, and in the bedroom? And why are the best decisions often those that are impossible to explain to others? In Blink we meet the psychologist who has learned to predict whether a marriage will last, based on a few minutes of observing a couple; the tennis coach who knows when a player will double-fault before the racket even makes contact with the ball; the antiquities experts who recognize a fake at a glance. Here, too, are great failures of ""blink"": the election of Warren Harding; ""New Coke""; and the shooting of Amadou Diallo by police. Blink reveals that great decision makers aren't those who process the most information or spend the most time deliberating, but those who have perfected the art of ""thin-slicing""--filtering the very few factors that matter from an overwhelming number of variables.",['Malcolm Gladwell'],Back Bay Books,2007,['Business & Economics'],3948.0,3.0,2005-01-30,Fun Read and a Thought: Is This Why Bush Is so Popular?,"A fun read, but a little frustrating.

Bush have a similar look about them.

"Slaughterhouse-five: Or, The children's crusade : a duty-dance with death","A special fiftieth anniversary edition of Kurt Vonnegut’s masterpiece, “a desperate, painfully honest attempt to confront the monstrous crimes of the twentieth century” (Time), featuring a new introduction by Kevin Powers, author of the National Book Award finalist The Yellow Birds Selected by the Modern Library as one of the 100 best novels of all time Slaughterhouse-Five, an American classic, is one of the world’s great antiwar books. Centering on the infamous World War II firebombing of Dresden, the novel is the result of what Kurt Vonnegut described as a twenty-three-year struggle to write a book about what he had witnessed as an American prisoner of war. It combines historical fiction, science fiction, autobiography, and satire in an account of the life of Billy Pilgrim, a barber’s son turned draftee turned optometrist turned alien abductee. As Vonnegut had, Billy experiences the destruction of Dresden as a POW. Unlike Vonnegut, he experiences time travel, or coming “unstuck in time.” An instant bestseller, Slaughterhouse-Five made Kurt Vonnegut a cult hero in American literature, a reputation that only strengthened over time, despite his being banned and censored by some libraries and schools for content and language. But it was precisely those elements of Vonnegut’s writing—the political edginess, the genre-bending inventiveness, the frank violence, the transgressive wit—that have inspired generations of readers not just to look differently at the world around them but to find the confidence to say something about it. Authors as wide-ranging as Norman Mailer, John Irving, Michael Crichton, Tim O’Brien, Margaret Atwood, Elizabeth Strout, David Sedaris, Jennifer Egan, and J. K. Rowling have all found inspiration in Vonnegut’s words. Jonathan Safran Foer has described Vonnegut as “the kind of writer who made people—young people especially—want to write.” George Saunders has declared Vonnegut to be “the great, urgent, passionate American writer of our century, who offers us . . . a model of the kind of compassionate thinking that might yet save us from ourselves.” Fifty years after its initial publication at the height of the Vietnam War, Vonnegut's portrayal of political disillusionment, PTSD, and postwar anxiety feels as relevant, darkly humorous, and profoundly affecting as ever, an enduring beacon through our own era’s uncertainties. “Poignant and hilarious, threaded with compassion and, behind everything, the cataract of a thundering moral statement.”—The Boston Globe",['Kurt Vonnegut'],Dial Press Trade Paperback,1999,['Fiction'],1523.0,2.0,2012-03-04,Slaughterhouse-Five,"I was disappointed with the book.

The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference (Wheeler Compass),An introduction to the Tipping Point theory explains how minor changes in ideas and products can increase their popularity and how small adjustments in an individual's immediate environment can alter group behavior.,['Malcolm Gladwell'],"Wheeler Publishing, Incorporated",2003,['Reference'],4218.0,4.0,2005-08-02,Great quick read,If you enjoy contemplating over the many things in this world on their origination or how they got to be the way they are than this book is a definite must read. This book gives a close look at a few different well known companies on their startup to stardom and also gives a good portion of the information that got them to where they are. Beyond that it applies those same features described in the corporate world to everyday things. This book is a quick read and quite interesting. The only thing I found to be a little less than appealing was that some of the references became somewhat repetitive and the information found seemed quite simple.,5,6
My Life So Far,"#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • Discover Jane Fonda, in her own words—and now experience the story of her life in the HBO documentary Jane Fonda in Five Acts. “To hold this book in your hands is to be astonished by how much living can be packed into sixty-plus years.”—Los Angeles Times America knows Jane Fonda as actress and activist, feminist and wife, workout guru and role model. In this extraordinary memoir, Fonda shows that she is much more. From her youth among Hollywood’s elite to her film career and her activism today, Fonda reveals intimate details and personal truths she hopes “can provide a lens through which others can see their lives and how they can live them a little differently.” Surprising, candid, and wonderfully written, My Life So Far is filled with insights into the personal struggles of a woman living a remarkable life. “In the process of writing this book I discovered there were clear, broad, even universal themes that ran through my life, a coherent arc to my journey that, if I could be truthful in the telling, might provide a road map for other women as they face the challenges of relationships, self-image, and forgiveness. What I did not anticipate was how my journey would also resonate with men.”—From the Introduction Praise for My Life So Far “[A] sisterly, enveloping memoir . . . an intimate, haunting book that might as well be catnip from its ever controversial author.”—Janet Maslin, The New York Times “Terrific . . . rich . . . unexpectedly quite moving.”—San Francisco Chronicle “Fiercely intelligent, detailed, probing, rigorously revealing.”—O: The Oprah Magazine “Fonda possesses a raw and affecting candor. . . . Her honesty [is] a force.”—The Philadelphia Inquirer “A fearless book . . . fascinating.”—Chicago Sun-Times “Truly compelling.”—The Atlanta Journal-Constitution “Riveting.”—Seattle Post-Intelligencer",['Jane Fonda'],Random House Trade Paperbacks,2006,['Biography & Autobiography'],7.0,4.0,2006-04-19,Evolving Personas Define a Remarkable Woman,"To say that Jane Fonda has led a full life seems like an understatement, and this 624-page book will vouch for that since what comes across is not as much the depth of the woman as much as it is the breadth of her life. I have been looking forward to this book for a long time, and at 67, Fonda remains a controversial icon and a person whose identity has evolved dramatically and not without her share of pain, sometimes self-inflicted. But this does not feel like a victim's tell-all, and frankly I'd have been surprised if it did as Fonda always strikes me as her father's daughter - impervious, principled, accomplished, preternaturally intelligent and gifted. As a result, the book feels more like a confessional about how she has reacted to the unexpected events in her life and how she has often been the impetus for many of the challenges she faced. Unlike her stoic father, she's not afraid to come across as self-absorbed, strident, sometimes overly cautious, and for all her intelligence, quite naive. The result is a believable portrait of a woman who has spent her entire life in the public eye, and for those reasons alone, her autobiography provides great value in revealing someone who takes accountability for both the successes and failures in her life.Fonda confidently and convincingly divides her life into three acts, asserting that she is near the beginning of Act III. Act I starts with a classic Hollywood childhood gone awry by an emotionally isolated father and a mentally disturbed mother who committed suicide. Similar to her friend Brooke Hayward's 1977 memoir ""Haywire"", this portion of the book reveals a world of privilege disconnected from notions of self-worth. Dysfunction becomes a way of life and leads the young Fonda into an extended period of self-loathing (exemplified by her long-running eating disorders) and a fear of genuine intimacy. Growing into a beautiful woman and a rising actress in the Hollywood firmament, she appeared to be quite sexually active (in her words, ""some pretty terrific fountains-of-Versailles-and fireworks sex!"") but could not make herself emotionally available. This allowed her first husband, director Roger Vadim, to become her Svengali, ultimately leading her to the infamous soft-porn camp classic, ""Barbarella"".As she and Vadim drifted into divorce, Fonda dove into politics with equal amounts passion and naivete. Often landing herself in hot water, she makes guarded apologies about her controversial trip to North Vietnam in 1972, but her political liberation kick-starts Act II, arguably her most fruitful period. She finally realized her potential as an actress winning two Oscars in the process and became involved with former Chicago Seven member, Tom Hayden. Despite his passion for economic democracy, he comes across as patronizing and sometimes quite cruel at a time when Fonda was coming into her own, as she became the queen of the workout video well before the concept became big business. The irony is that he resented her success even though the profits funded his political activities. Act II ends with her turbulent ten-year marriage to media mogul Ted Turner, a megalomaniac whom Fonda treats with respect and an occasional sense of regret. For all his out-of-control habits and predilections, he understood what she needed even though the world could not make sense as to why these two political opposites would marry. Act III shows her as active as ever, a born-again Christian reigniting her acting career after fifteen years and focusing on issues regarding adolescent reproductive health, sexuality and pregnancy. I am looking forward to what she'll do next.This is not a perfect book. Her writing can fluctuate wildly in tone from being a mite too matter-of-fact to overwhelming in its use of self-conscious psychology and politically naive pontification. And I'm probably among the minority in wishing that she could have delved even deeper into her movies and the filmmaking process. These relatively minor flaws aside, one gets the sense of a complete, unfiltered person from this book. I remember very well her prancing around that cold attic apartment as an impetuous newlywed with Robert Redford in ""Barefoot in the Park"". And following her from that moment through all her different public personas has been quite a rollercoaster, but the journey certainly remains unparalleled among second-generation Hollywood progeny. Jane Fonda is indeed a remarkable woman unapologetic about the sometimes unwise decisions that have shaped her legacy. This is a fascinating memoir, and the paperback version also comes with a DVD with excerpts from her 2005 interview with James Lipton on ""Inside the Actors' Studio"".",16,20

However, the author frames his supposed ""debate"" in such a way as to not allow a full airing of Freud's views while always positioning C.S. Lewis as the final answer on the subject. The numerous problems with Lewis' thoughts are never pointed out, let alone explored. All of Lewis' supposed responses would work equally as well for any other believer in any other theistic religion, yet this point seems lost on the author. The author also conveniently ignores the fact that since Freud didn't have the opportunity to answer Lewis directly, other have do so repeatedly and with great convincing.

"An Artist's Book of Inspiration: A Collection of Thoughts on Art, Artists, Creativity","This collection of thoughts from artists and thinkers of the past and present has been lovingly gathered over many years in the personal journals of the artist Astrid Fitzgerald and reveals something of the mystery in which creativity finds its way from the energies of the cosmos into the imagination and faculties of the individual artist and eventually into the solitude of the studio and finally into a work of art. From the reports of mystics to the observations of scientists, these passages have been arranged in this volume to provide brief glimpses into the recesses of artistic being, into the tentative formations in consciousness, the first glimmers of imagination, the distinctive faculties of the creative mind, and the tensions of artistic expression in the workshop and the creative life. Fitzgerald's great contribution has been to gather into a meaningful collection the words of 2,500 years of genius as a resource and inspiration for all those who would break out of creative limitations and take a bold step into the future. Illustrated with the art of the author and others.

Wait till next year,"When historian Goodwin was six years old, her father taught her how to keep score for ‘their’ team, the Brooklyn Dodgers, which forged a lifelong bond between father and daughter. Set in the suburbs of New York in the 1950s, Wait Till Next Year is a coming-of-age memoir in the era of Jackie Robinson, Pee Wee Reese and Duke Snider, when baseball truly was a national pastime that brought whole communities together. With her radio by her side and scorecard to hand, she recreates the postwar era, when the corner store was a place to share stories and neighborhoods were equally divided between Dodger, Giant, and Yankee fans. Weaved between the games and the seasons, Goodwin tells the story of a changing America – from the lunacy of the Cold War alarm drills to McCarthy and the Rosenburg trials – as well as her own loss of innocence encapsulated by her mother’s death, her father’s lapse into despair and the Dodger’s departure from Brooklyn in 1957 following the destruction of the iconic Ebbets Field stadium. Poignant, unsentimental and deeply eloquent, Wait Till Next Year is a profound memoir about childhood and loss, baseball, and the power of sport to bind families and heal loss and reveal as metaphor the evolving heart of a nation.",['Doris Kearns Goodwin'],Aurum,2014,['Sports & Recreation'],14.0,5.0,2012-10-06,Attention Baseball Lovers!,"Doris Kearns Goodwin, a noted journalist, changes gears with this memoir of growing up on Long Island in the 50s. Her dad taught her how to score a Dodgers baseball game when she was six; she believed that he would miss out on the game if she didn't keep an accurate scorecard and narrate the action when he returned from his job each day. The longer and more entertaining her narration was, the longer she was able to spend in his company; she credits him with giving her confidence in her story-telling abilities. As she recounts the golden era of baseball (3 teams, remember--Giants, Yankees, and her fave, the Dodgers), the reader also learns the history of a special time.

Frankenstein (Running Press classics),A scientist assembles a monster from parts of deadbodies which develops a mind of his own as he learns to loathe himself and his creator.,['Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley'],Running Press Book Publishers,1990,['Frankenstein (Fictitious character)'],1083.0,4.0,2002-02-25,The definative guide to humanity,"Frankenstein is a very well presented view of how society did, and still does, view the unusual and different. Mary Shelley did an excellent job portraying the monster, and an even better job showing his human emotions and compassion. At first, you are led to believe that the creature is an abomination in the name of human kind, but quickly realize that he did not ask to be created, and that he is nothing more than what his creator's hands molded. This is also a look into the subject of human beings ""playing god"", and offers many viewpoints that might otherwise be overlooked. Furthermore, it can be incorporated with modern subjects, where everything is not ""black and white"", but where there is a ""gray"" uncertain area (cloning, etc.). A must read for anyone who enjoys drama, especially those readers with ethical questions in a modern chaotic world.",1,2

I picked up the Tiegers' book at a book sale and certainly do not regret it. The book is well written and fills an urgent need: it attempts to help the concerned reader answer the ages old question, what am I supposed to do with my life? All sixteen types are given ample attention and the book offers many suggestions for pursuing a career based on your personality type. Each section has detailed, real life examples of successful matches between personality types and careers.However, I have a few concerns about the book that prevent it from receiving a five star rating. The book does not mention entrepreneurship at all (a minor point). It also does not give an explanation that I recall regarding how the Tiegers reached the conclusions they wrote about. In my case I was indifferent to many of the suggestions that they gave as career choices for my type, and was actually turned off to several. Capability is different than interest. Another problem is that socialization or other experiences in a person's life may lead to an enjoyable career that is not what a reading of the innate preferences and combination of preferences may suggest. The Tiegers addressed these concerns...somewhat. In my specific case I concluded that my potential career goals and career path need to involve different ideas and suggestions than what the Tiegers asserted.That said, I still recommend the book. Someone who is younger, college or high school age, for example, or someone (probably still younger aged) who is completely unhappy in their job might greatly benefit from reading the book and acting on its advice. A mediocre resource is probably better than no resource, and Do What You Are is not mediocre - it's good, but not great.",25,27

The inspiration for the upcoming original series on Prime Video, The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power. The Two Towers is the second part of J.R.R. Tolkien’s epic adventure The Lord of the Rings. One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them. Frodo and his Companions of the Ring have been beset by danger during their quest to prevent the Ruling Ring from falling into the hands of the Dark Lord by destroying it in the Cracks of Doom. They have lost the wizard, Gandalf, in a battle in the Mines of Moria. And Boromir, seduced by the power of the Ring, tried to seize it by force. While Frodo and Sam made their escape, the rest of the company was attacked by Orcs. Now they continue the journey alone down the great River Anduin—alone, that is, save for the mysterious creeping figure that follows wherever they go.

Unlike ""The Fellowship of the Ring,"" Tolkien's first installment, which at times was compelled to slow to a snail's pace to patiently set up the story, THE TWO TOWERS moves the reader along at a rapid clip, from the first page to the last.Here we are also introduced to a rich variety of new characters: Eomer, King Theoden, the evil Wormtongue, Treebeard the Ent, Faramir of Gondor, and a nasty assortment of snarling orcs.

The Sigma Protocol,"Now comes The Sigma Protocol, a new breakneck novel of intrigue, conspiracy, and terrifying deception. American investment banker Ben Hartman arrives in Zurich for a ski holiday, the first time he's been back to Switzerland since his twin brother died there in a tragic accident four years earlier. But his arrival in Zurich triggers something far more sinister than his brother's fate. When Ben chances upon Jimmy Cavanaugh, an old college friend, Cavanaugh promptly pulls out a gun and tries to kill him. In a matter of minutes, several innocent bystanders are dead - as well as Cavanaugh - and Ben has barely managed to survive. Plunged into an unspeakable nightmare, Hartman suddenly finds himself on the run. Department of Justice field agent Anna Navarro is being stalked around the world by a relentless killer, managing to survive the killer's attacks only by a combination of luck, skill and her own quick wits. These attacks are somehow related to her current assignment: investigating the sudden - and seemingly unrelated - deaths of a number of very old men throughout the world. The only thing that connects them is a file in the CIA archives, over a half-century old, marked with the same puzzling code word: SIGMA. But someone or something is always seemingly one step ahead of her, the survivors are rapidly dwindling, and her own life is in ever increasing danger. Brought together by accident, Ben and Anna soon realize that their only hope of survival lies with each other. Together they race to uncover the diabolical secrets long hidden behind the code word, Sigma. Secrets that threaten everything they think they know about themselves, everything they believed true about their friends and families, and everything they were ever taught about history itself. For behind Sigma lies a vast deception that is finally coming to fruition and the fate and future of the world is in their hands.",['Robert Ludlum'],St. Martin's Press,2007,['Fiction'],10.0,3.0,2003-06-10,Tired of Nazi's,"Okay, Sigma Protocol started out great.

Such stuff exist, and it was strange to have a relationship with a book years after. Granted, it was not something written by a grown woman, but the ideas are there for every female or want to be female 20s. I tend to think the author might hold a tinge of regret over the treatment of women in general, but in general, kept the character down to earth and surrounded with domestics things. There are not overly dwelling on particular feelings explored when a person passes through high school in Western Society, but the idea of seeing which type of women could survive is very real and very cold, to myself at the time. It is also very real and somehow really french, the idea on Western men think of women wrestling each other, but also distinctly Chinese in origin to myself. Particularly, when it is written by LaoTze and every other other philosopher life is challenging or made so by the women or the ignoble soul. Either way, the trials faced by the young women in the books are nothing to laugh off, but the young ""heroine"" is made to feel worse to read. The passages are brutal about every actions person and there are not really kind treatment towards the more feminist set of men, who may be homosexuals but not clearly said. In the end, it is about love being there, always, but being able to treat life kindly and truly kind to the wounds sprayed by others and self at the same time. There maybe versions online to read, but the hardcover is what I read for high school and college as part of refreshing my written english, and it is part of English literature class reading list.",0,0
Genius: the Life and Science of Richard Feynman,"New York Times Bestseller: This life story of the quirky physicist is “a thorough and masterful portrait of one of the great minds of the century” (The New York Review of Books). Raised in Depression-era Rockaway Beach, physicist Richard Feynman was irreverent, eccentric, and childishly enthusiastic—a new kind of scientist in a field that was in its infancy. His quick mastery of quantum mechanics earned him a place at Los Alamos working on the Manhattan Project under J. Robert Oppenheimer, where the giddy young man held his own among the nation’s greatest minds. There, Feynman turned theory into practice, culminating in the Trinity test, on July 16, 1945, when the Atomic Age was born. He was only twenty-seven. And he was just getting started. In this sweeping biography, James Gleick captures the forceful personality of a great man, integrating Feynman’s work and life in a way that is accessible to laymen and fascinating for the scientists who follow in his footsteps.",['James Gleick'],Open Road Media,2011,['Biography & Autobiography'],18.0,2.0,2012-12-25,VERY DRY -- from an Engineering Major,"I wanted to learn more about quantum mechanics and a friend recommended this book to me...Unfortunately, I found this book incredibly DRY and BORING! This book seemed to just be a series of mathematical/physics problems (complete with diagrams). The science was too detailed for the average reader and probably too basic for physicists/mathematicians. So, not sure who the author was targeting as an audience. I was an engineering major who loved calculus and physics as an undergraduate. Yet, I found I had to skip around the book after the first 100 pages because the prose just didn't hold my attention.Sprinkled between Feynman's scientific projects were anecdotes about his early years, first wife, Arline, his strained relationship with his mother, and his subsequent and notorious womanizing. Yet, their place in the storyline is so disjointed that I never got a sense of Feynman the man...just Feynman the reputed whiz-kid whose life seemed solely comprised of his scientific work to the extent that he is socially awkward, uninterested - and essentially illiterate - in the literature, the arts or anything outside science. Either he was an incredibly uni-dimensional person or the author does him a big disservice and makes him seem so.In comparison, the stellar biography of Einstein by Walter Isaacson does a great job of humanizing the last century's most iconic scientist. He also creates a nice balance of discussing enough scientific theory to make one appreciate the importance of Einstein's work but told in a way that is understandable and interesting to the general public. Unfortunately, despite Gleick's apparent admiration for his subject, Richard Feynman, his biography does not bring Feynman to life. There is definitely room for a better, more fluid biography on this great scientist - regardless of the prizes the book may have garnered when it first came out in 1993.BTW, I ended up going to Youtube and Wikipedia to find out more on Feynman and Quantum Mechanics.

S is for Silence (Kinsey Millhone Mysteries),"Thirty-four years after Violet Sullivan's unexplained disappearance, Daisy--the not-quite-seven-year-old daughter she left behind--enlists the assistance of private detective Kinsey Millhone to help her find the truth.",['Sue Grafton'],G.P. Putnam's Sons,2016,['California'],36.0,5.0,2005-12-13,Unlike any of Grafton's previous novels,"Violet Sullivan patted her hair, applied her trademark violet cologne, checked the hemline of her purple sundress, and tucked her Pomeranian pup in her straw bag. She poked her head around the bathroom door to say goodnight to her seven-year-old daughter Daisy in a bubble bath and her regular babysitter, Liza. She blew them both a kiss, climbed into her brand new Chevy Bel Air sedan, backed down the drive, filled the gas tank at a highway gas station, and vanished. It was the 4th of July, 1953 in Serena Station, California. Violet was headed for the fireworks celebration but never showed up.Tongues wagged, police investigated, and speculation mounted in the sleepy little town. Old case files would show that Violet had emptied her safety deposit box of a rumored $50,000 insurance cash settlement and that her favorite outfits were missing from her closet. Her reputation as a loose woman around town led some to figure she had left her brutish husband to run off with a lover. Others believed her husband finally had had enough and killed her in a drunken rage during one of their well-known fights. But there was no body, no abandoned car, no wandering puppy --- not a sign of Violet anywhere. Life pretty much went on after the scandal died down. Thirty-four years later, her daughter, Daisy, blames the disappearance of her mother for her current unhappiness. She decides to find out what really happened to Violet Sullivan, come what may.Private detective Kinsey Millhone's established reputation leads Daisy to her office. Missing persons cases are not in Kinsey's resume, but Daisy's story is so compelling that Kinsey names her price and reluctantly takes the case.When Sue Grafton launched A IS FOR ALIBI in the spring of 1982, the book was heralded by readers and critics alike for its sassy protagonist, Kinsey Millhone, and its bravura debut of what looked like a very ambitious undertaking. If A was for alibi, could an alphabet series all the way to Z be in Grafton's future? She had worked as a Hollywood screenwriter for nearly a decade, survived a nasty divorce, and often fantasized, according to one biographer, of ways to murder her ex-husband. Banging out stories on deadline was a way of life, but it was a grind she no longer wanted to continue, so she created the irrepressible Kinsey of the ever-present little black dress and the beater Volkswagen Beetle.Kinsey's career and life have moved forward five years during the first 18 books in the bestselling detective series. The ubiquitous Beetle has been traded for a newer model. The black dress that served as a trusty prop went up in smoke with the original car, but her wardrobe has remained as casual and ready for action as ever. The angst and introspection of Kinsey's own past in recent books is behind her.S IS FOR SILENCE is a departure from the formula that had become the signature of the Alphabet mysteries. Grafton could, as many series writers do, rest on her laurels and pound out another enjoyable read with the same characters --- Rosie at the diner, Charlie her landlord, Cheney her boyfriend. A week in the life of Kinsey Millhone, on the hunt for a bad guy. Instead, she chose to write a novel laced with atmosphere, delivering a plot with punch and action. She takes the reader back to the sounds, the colors, and the peace and quiet of a sleepy California town in the early 1950s. The story of what happened to a flamboyant, bored young woman, her daughter, her husband, the babysitter, and the men in town who hung out at the Moon Bar and Grill is told from the point of view of each of the people who knew and loved Violet.S IS FOR SILENCE is unlike any of Grafton's prior books, some of which readers and critics felt were becoming hackneyed. She's met the daunting challenge of the alphabet by pushing the envelope. With only seven to go, Kinsey exhibits welcome signs of life and excitement ahead.

Our perfect society achieved peace and stability through the prohibition of monogamy, privacy, money, family and history itself. Now everyone belongs. You can be happy too. All you need to do is take your Soma pills. Discover the brave new world of Aldous Huxley's classic novel, written in 1932, which prophesied a society which expects maximum pleasure and accepts complete surveillance - no matter what the cost. 'A masterpiece of speculation... As vibrant, fresh, and somehow shocking as it was when I first read it' Margaret Atwood, bestselling author of The Handmaid's Tale 'A grave warning... Provoking, stimulating, shocking and dazzling' Observer **One of the BBC's 100 Novels That Shaped Our World**",['Aldous Huxley'],Random House,2008,['Fiction'],2713.0,5.0,2008-03-30,"Way Ahead of its time, and durable","This novel is a biting critique of the over-scientification of the emerging modern world, and in particular a scathing critique of early movements towards behavioral conditioning, as well as towards psychoanalysis, mass production, the use of drugs to affect and modify behavior, as well as mass consumerism, all of which had begun to appear around the turn of the 20th Century.Huxley creates an imaginary ""overly controlled,"" ""overly conditioned"" and ""overly bureaucratized"" utopia, one that was supposed to produce world stability and unattainable and unimaginable individual happiness under a regime of benign tyranny. However, when judged by the results and effects on its inhabitants, the utopia turns out to be just the opposite: an avowed dystopia.Mustapha Mond, one of the characters and a member of the ruling elite had decided that all of art must be sacrificed in order to increase the overall happiness of the society. But in a discussion with an inhabitant who existed on the margins of the managed state, he was surprised to learn that the individual, the character, John Savage, disagreed with him and made the radical claim that in order to be free, and even to maximize happiness, people must be allowed the right to be unhappy as well to be happy.From before birth until they were in the grave, the lives of the inhabitants of Huxley's imaginary London were conditioned so that every aspect of their lives were carefully managed by strict rules and by state administered drugs to create the kind of behavior that best suited the needs of those ruling the state. Even fetuses were treated chemically to produce the kind of intelligence that the ruling bureaucrats had decided were in the best interests of the kind of societal stratifications and chosen roles within society that the ruling elites had decided were necessary.American satire rarely gets better than this and not since George Orwell's Animal Farm and his equally effective, 1984, has a single piece of political fiction sounded as many cautionary alarm bells as this cautionary tale. It has proven amazingly durable and prescient in retrospect.Five Stars.",1,2
The Old Patagonian Express,"The acclaimed travel writer journeys by train across the Americas from Boston to Patagonia in this international bestselling travel memoir. Starting with a rush-hour subway ride to South Station in Boston to catch the Lake Shore Limited to Chicago, Paul Theroux takes a grand railway adventure first across the United States and then south through Mexico, Central America, and across the Andes until he winds up on the meandering Old Patagonian Express steam engine. His epic commute finally comes to a halt in a desolate land of cracked hills and thorn bushes that reaches toward Antarctica. Along the way, Theroux demonstrates how train travel can reveal “""the social miseries and scenic splendors” of a continent. And through his perceptive prose we learn that what matters most are the people he meets along the way, including the monologuing Mr. Thornberry in Costa Rica, the bogus priest of Cali, and the blind Jorge Luis Borges, who delights in having Theroux read Robert Louis Stevenson to him.",['Paul Theroux'],Houghton Mifflin Harcourt,2014,['Travel'],13.0,5.0,2006-01-12,Paul Theroux - Travel Writer Extraordinaire!,"For me, discovering a new author is like happening upon a gem of a restaurant that serves up a fascinating new concatenation of spices and flavors. Paul Theroux is the flavor of the month for me. I recall that several years ago I read his book about traveling along the perimeter of the Mediterranean - The Pillars of Hercules. I loved the book, and picked up used copies of some of his other titles. These volumes I placed on one of the many shelves in my home that I have mentally labeled: ""To Be Read When I Can Find The Time""! In the past few weeks, I took the time to read two of those volumes, and I could not be more pleased.Let me offer you a soupcon from one of his travel books, and another morsel from one of his novels.How can you not love a travel book that begins on a cold winter's day on the Orange Line on Boston's legendary T - and ends in the wilds of Argentina's Patagonia region. I have had a fascination with Patagonia since my days of studying French at Governor Dummer Academy under the tutelage of Roy A. Ohrn. R.A.O., as he was called by all the students, had been educated at The Sorbonne, and taught in the classic style. IF he caught a student daydreaming in class, he would exclaim: ""Monsieur, vous tes en Patagonie!"" I am sure this was a subliminal reason for my picking up a paperback copy of The Old Patagonian Express - By Train Through The Americas.Theroux takes us to Guatemala:""Now there were volcanoes all around us, or volcanic hills with footstool shapes that the Mexicans call `little ovens.' It was cooler, and as the sun grew pinker and a ridge of hills rose to meet it where it hovered drawn to the shape of a chalice, near the Pacific, the gathering darkness threw halftones across the hills. The fragments of white were the hats and shirts of cane cutters marching home. But it was not an ordinary jungle twilight, with the mold of shadow under wide, gleaming leaves, flickering hit fires, and the jostlings of mottled pigs and goats. The sky was in flames far off, and when we came closer, the fire was revealed as enormous: bonfires of waste cane burned in sloping fields and sent up cloud tides that were purple and orange and crimson; they floated and lost their color, becoming white until the night absorbed them. Then this smoke fogged the tracks and it was as if we were traveling on some antique steam locomotive in a mountain pass in Asia, through fog that smelled of stale candy. We roared by and left three men, still hungry on the tracks, ploddingly watching the tail lights wizen and converge, slipping gimleted and neatly out of sight."" (Page 104)""Churches were built - a dozen of Spanish loveliness, with slender steeples and finely furnished porches and domes. The earth shook - not much, but enough to split them. Tremors left cracks between windows and separated, in the stained glass of those windows, the shepherd from his brittle flock, the saint from his gold staff, the martyr from his persecutors. Christs were parted from their crosses, and the anatomy of chapel Virgins violated as their enameling, the porcelain white of faces and fingers, shattered, sometimes with a report that startled the faithful in their prayers. The windows, the statues, the masonry, were mended; and gold leaf was applied thickly to the splintered altars. It seemed the churches had been made whole again. But the motion of the earthquakes had never really ceased."" (Page 105)""Anyone who finds a frenzied secularity at a church service in Guatemala - and thinks it should be stamped out - ought to go to the North End of Boston on the feast day of Saint Anthony and consider the probability of redemption n the scuffles of ten thousand Italians frantically pinning dollar bills to the cassock of their patron saint, who is borne on a litter past pizza parlors and mafia hangouts in a procession headed by a wailing priest and six smirking acolytes. Compared to that, the goings-on at La Merced were solemn."" (Page 107)I admire that kind of writing. It brought back to me the sounds and smells and sights of Haiti.In addition to being a prolific traveler who writes prosaically about his travels, Theroux has penned over a dozen novels, including ""The Mosquito Coast"" that was made into a film that starred Harrison Ford. I just finished reading My Secret History - a thinly veiled fictionalized autobiography of Theroux. He tells the story of a writer from Boston whose habit of living double lives follows him around the world and throughout his life.Theroux sets an elegiac tone even before launching his story, as he opens the book with this epigram, quoting A.E. Housman:Into my heart an air that killsFrom yon far country blows:What are those blue remembered hills,What spires, what farms are those?That is the land of lost content,I see it shining plain:The happy highways where I wentAnd cannot come again.Through the eyes of his protagonist, Andre Parent, Theroux comments knowingly on the complexities of the human condition:""But nothing is worse than disgrace. It is lonely and irreversible - a terrible mess. The loud snorting laughter it produces is worse than anguish. Having to live through disgrace is worse than dying."" (Page 69)It is my understanding that Theroux, this son of Boston, now lives in Hawaii. I hope the day will come when he returns to the Hub so we can swap stories with each other while bumping along on the Orange Line!Al",9,11

The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier,"Walking his two young children to school every morning, Thad Carhart passes an unassuming little storefront in his Paris neighborhood. Intrigued by its simple sign—Desforges Pianos—he enters, only to have his way barred by the shop’s imperious owner. Unable to stifle his curiosity, he finally lands the proper introduction, and a world previously hidden is brought into view. Luc, the atelier’s master, proves an indispensable guide to the history and art of the piano. Intertwined with the story of a musical friendship are reflections on how pianos work, their glorious history, and stories of the people who care for them, from amateur pianists to the craftsmen who make the mechanism sing. The Piano Shop on the Left Bank is at once a beguiling portrait of a Paris not found on any map and a tender account of the awakening of a lost childhood passion. Praise for The Piano Shop on the Left Bank: “[Carhart’s] writing is fluid and lovely enough to lure the rustiest plunker back to the piano bench and the most jaded traveler back to Paris.” –San Francisco Chronicle “Captivating . . . [Carhart] joins the tiny company of foreigners who have written of the French as verbs. . . . What he tries to capture is not the sight of them, but what they see.” –The New York Times “Thoroughly engaging . . . In part it is a book about that most unpredictable and pleasurable of human experiences, serendipity. . . . The book is also about something more difficult to pin down, friendship and community.” –The Washington Post “Carhart writes with a sensuousness enhanced by patience and grounded by the humble acquisition of new insight into music, his childhood, and his relationship to the city of Paris.” –The New Yorker NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY THE WASHINGTON POST BOOK WORLD",['Thad Carhart'],Random House Trade Paperbacks,2002,['Music'],27.0,5.0,2001-07-02,Stuff I never even thought about...,"Grew up as the atonal curmudgeon in a thoroughly musical household -- my mother got her BA in music at age 70 and still teaches piano at age 80 -- but Carhart walks one through the &quot;quartier musique&quot; in such a fashion that even I thoroughly enjoyed the stroll. His rediscovery of the piano begins with his own story but fear not, the book moves briskly away from the personal and captures the reader's attention and interest as Carhart writes of the wonderful complexity of this commonplace thing: the piano. The descriptions of the master classes and the visit to the Fazioli piano factory are brilliant concluding pieces to this very well-crafted volume. In essence the book embodies much of what Carhart has to tell us about the piano. As well he treats Paris and the French with due consideration and appreciation and never condescends to his reader. A delightful read that gains momentum.",8,11

I Capture the Castle,"“Every time I meet someone who also loves I Capture the Castle, I know we must be kindred spirits.” —from the new foreword by Jenny Han, the New York Times bestselling author of To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before. A beautiful, deluxe edition of Dodie Smith’s beloved novel, I Capture the Castle, featuring a new foreword by New York Times bestselling author Jenny Han, a stunning new cover, and designed endpapers that is perfect for devoted readers and those discovering this timeless story for the first time. Seventeen-year-old Cassandra Mortmain and her family may live in a ramshackle old English castle, but that’s about as romantic as her life gets. While her beautiful older sister, Rose, longs to live in a Jane Austen novel, Cassandra knows that meeting an eligible man to marry isn’t in either of their futures when their home is crumbling and they have to sell their furniture for food. So Cassandra instead strives to hone her writing skills in her journals. Until one day when their new landlords move in, which include two (very handsome) sons, and the lives of the Mortmain sisters change forever. Through Cassandra’s sharply funny, yet poignant, journal entries, she chronicles the great changes that take place within the castle’s walls, and her own first descent into love. By the time she pens her final entry, she has “captured the castle” – and the heart of the reader – in one of literature’s most enchanting novels. “This book has one of the most charismatic narrators I've ever met.” —J.K. Rowling, bestselling author of the Harry Potter series",['Dodie Smith'],St. Martin's Griffin,2017,['Young Adult Fiction'],188.0,4.0,2002-11-26,Magical and Innocent,"&quot;I Capture the Castle&quot; by Dodie Smith is like a beautiful painting of words. It's about 17 year old Cassandra Mortmain and her family, who live in an old ruined castle in England. Her father is a writer with severe writers block, but who wrote an obscure book, which was one of the most important books of that generation. This book is about her experiences, going from poverty to wealth, from loneliness to love, from complete estrangement from her father to a daughter again. Written as a sort of journal, it chronicles her life for what seems to be about a year. It is written beautifully, very expressively, and to me seems to have an ethereal quality. Some characters are well thought out, and necessarily deep, whereas some, such as Mrs Cotton, are just small, sometimes comedic, sometimes more sombre, pencil-sketches.Cassandra lives through desparate poverty, her father's mood swings, her sister's love affair, falling in love herself, her step-mother's odd habits and rituals, the &quot;hired&quot; help's love for her, and records all of it in hindsight, often with amazing insight and maturity, while maintaining the voice of a 17 year old.This book, to my mind, brings back images of the novels I read when I was young - narrative, and with seemingly no other deeper messages to convey. It is the type of book that I can imagine a mother giving a daughter to read. It is wonderfully innocent, and yet delightfully ravishing to the senses. It is timeless, and creates the English country village scene without any real reference to year or generation. It was a joy to read, and I hope that others find the same pleasure in it that I found.",0,0
Lightning (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition),"Sensei Wu must teach the Ninjago warriors the ancient art of spinjitzu in order to defeat Lord Garmadon, but first the ninja Jay, whose sense of humor is strong even in battle, must learn when it is the right time to be serious.",['Greg Farshtey'],Scholastic Inc.,2012,['Juvenile Fiction'],1.0,5.0,2012-03-11,Excellent.,"Laura Shane's had a rough life. With some of the disasters life throws at her, she notices a amazing lightning storm. With the lightning comes a mysterious man to save her from the tradegy. She quickly labels him her guardian. Is he an angel or something else? All she knows for sure is that he's around thirty-five, goodlooking, and never seems to age...In boredom I dug out my old Koontz books and reread a couple. Suprising myself that this book, though written twenty-five years ago, still reads well today. Sounds impossible, but it's not. This book still works. I post on a lot of teen fiction and this one fits in perfectly. Koontz builds and progresses his amazing characters like the master he is. He also sends us a message with each book. A lesson for life. Though we already know the lessons, its nice form that he tries.Koontz writes a lot of supernatural. Usually government experiments gone wrong. A secret government weapon escapes to go on a killing spree. Maybe a CIA agent flips out and turns into a random seriel killer. Stuff like that. He makes excellent characters, and has a lot of dark humor. Almost every villain he makes is scary, clever, and also hilarious. Lightning has all of the humor you expect with a Dean Koontz book. He writes in third person shifting views between Laura, the guardian, and the killers. Lightning is one of his best, and a must read. Expect to be shocked, To cry, to bite your nails, and laugh your head off.Negatives.Once you learn the guardians trick, you will see a few plot errors. But, this subject can't be written about without errors. Paradoxes. I'm giving it five stars for the characters, wonderful storyline, the laughs, but most of all because it's still good today.Koontz also puts a lot of details into settings. Too many imo. Sometimes two paragraphs to describe the outside of a apartment building. He also uses a lot of words to describe California property and I have no idea what they mean. I can't remember all of them, but some might be veranda, stucco or stuff like that. Can't he consider uneducated people like to read to? Why can't it just be a two story house with a large white porch?As with any good author he copies some of his own material. Not much. You can read ten or so of his books, but then you start noticing a lot of similarities. The government screwups. The guys on the run usually steal a car, and plates from another. They almost always run to San Francisco and find fake ID's. Why not though? If it works stick with it. It's small stuff anyway and as I said you won't even notice until you read a lot of them.His books are clean in language and sexuality, but maybe too violent for teens today. Since we're trying to keep our teens from seeing anything violent. I personally think these are fine for teens. Your through his violent scenes before you know it, and when you think about it later, you laugh. I can't imagine anyone reading a Koontz book and going on a shooting spree. If anything they might grow a little weary of secret government experiments.",0,0

Jerusalem Countdown: A Warning to the World,The author identifies key players in nuclear development and offers prophetic insights,['John Hagee'],Charisma Media,2006,['Religion'],30.0,2.0,2007-10-11,"Well Written, Poorly Researched War Tract","John Hagee is a powerful preacher, but he is not a theologian. This becomes evident as you read Jerusalem Countdown. Basically, the theme of the book is that Iran is preparing nuclear weapons, and that very soon, we will be seeing the invasion of Israel that Ezekiel prophesied in Ezekiel 38-39.Not only is Hagee wrong in his predictions of Iranian acquisition of nuclear materials (he predicted that it would be known by the fall of 2006), but his facts are wrong in many other places.For example, he claims that 6000 people died in the September 11th attacks, when we know now that it was closer to 3000. He also overestimates the number of casualities in the Japanese attacks on Pearl Harbor.He also equates support for the people of Israel with support for the current secular national government in Israel, not necessarily the same thing.But Hagee's biggest mistakes are with the Scriptures. He takes Bible passages referring to the destruction of Solomon's temple in 586 BC, and applies them to the destruction of Herod's temple in 70 AD, a common mistake that Bible students make.But the worst part of the book is Hagee's mishandling of the book of Romans. He claims that Romans 9-11 is a separate tract that doesn't fit at all with the rest of Romans, even though Romans 1-8 has numerous references to God's plan for the Jewish people (see especially Romans 1:16-17, Romans 2:1-32, Romans 3, etc).Another bad thing about the book is that it is a war-mongering, fear mongering book designed to scare the wits out of people. There is no sense of God's love shown in Christ's death on the cross, no sense of hope, no discussion of the future millennium, no discussion of the final victory of God in the new heaven and the new earth.The bottom line is that God is sovereign over history and by looking unto Jesus and putting our hope in Him, all things will work together for the good of those who love God (Hebrews 12:2, Romans 8:28).The best part of this book is when Hagee compares the life of Jesus with the life of Moses, and with the life of Joseph. That part of the book was right on and was very informative.The rest of the book was right wing Zionism on steroids. I agree that someday, Christ will reign over the earth in Jerusalem for a thousand years, and that the people of Israel will be back in the land.But I think that the gathering of the Jewish people into Israel is something that we should let God orchestrate (Ezekiel 39:25-29, Jeremiah 31:23, Isaiah 43:5-7, 51:11, etc) rather than to let it be the work of conservative activists.",14,21

Journey Through Genius: The Great Theorems of Mathematics,"Like masterpieces of art, music, and literature, great mathematical theorems are creative milestones, works of genius destined to last forever. Now William Dunham gives them the attention they deserve. Dunham places each theorem within its historical context and explores the very human and often turbulent life of the creator — from Archimedes, the absentminded theoretician whose absorption in his work often precluded eating or bathing, to Gerolamo Cardano, the sixteenth-century mathematician whose accomplishments flourished despite a bizarre array of misadventures, to the paranoid genius of modern times, Georg Cantor. He also provides step-by-step proofs for the theorems, each easily accessible to readers with no more than a knowledge of high school mathematics. A rare combination of the historical, biographical, and mathematical, Journey Through Genius is a fascinating introduction to a neglected field of human creativity. “It is mathematics presented as a series of works of art; a fascinating lingering over individual examples of ingenuity and insight. It is mathematics by lightning flash.” —Isaac Asimov",['William Dunham'],Penguin Books,1991,['Biography & Autobiography'],14.0,5.0,2004-08-29,A marvelous history of significant mathametics,"Well I couldn't fit the entire title I wanted.

The Lord of the Rings - Boxed Set,"This beautiful gift edition of The Hobbit, J.R.R. Tolkien's classic prelude to his Lord of the Rings trilogy, features cover art, illustrations, and watercolor paintings by the artist Alan Lee. Bilbo Baggins is a hobbit who enjoys a comfortable, unambitious life, rarely traveling any farther than his pantry or cellar. But his contentment is disturbed when the wizard Gandalf and a company of dwarves arrive on his doorstep one day to whisk him away on an adventure. They have launched a plot to raid the treasure hoard guarded by Smaug the Magnificent, a large and very dangerous dragon. Bilbo reluctantly joins their quest, unaware that on his journey to the Lonely Mountain he will encounter both a magic ring and a frightening creature known as Gollum. Written for J.R.R. Tolkien's own children, The Hobbit has sold many millions of copies worldwide and established itself as a modern classic.",['J.R.R. Tolkien'],HarperCollins,2012,['Young Adult Fiction'],38.0,3.0,2008-09-22,"I'll always have a soft spot for this program, but it could still have been done much better.","I was first exposed to the wonderful world of Middle_Earth largely at the insistance of my fourth-grade teacher. She had both the American radiodramas of the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings available for anyone to check out. Perhaps because I was only ten at the time, I enjoyed the acting and sound effects, which I must say were done better in the Hobbit than in the Lord of the Rings. This program was released a year or so before I was born, in 1979 if I remember right, and so it's understandable that they wouldn't be able to do as much with the story as they probably could nowadays.First I'll start with the things I liked about it. The soundtrack for this paticular dramatization is composed of classical pieces that, though not specifically written for the program, fit in quite well, at least as far as I'm concerned. For peaceful moments inth estory you get pieceful music, then for the battles the music becomes more tense.The cast is something of a mixed bag. I like them, but I've always felt that each actor had too many parts to work with, so several characters ended up sounding the same. I didn't know Gimley and Gloin were exactly the same person. Voiced by the same actor (Gail Chugg, the narrator), it would be easy to confuse them if Gloin had featured more prominently in Lord of the Rings. Also, the same actor who portrays Frodo also portrays Saruman.One thing I didn't like nearly as much about this adaptation are the sound effects. While most of them are extremely realistic, horses' hooves, crackling fires, rushing streams and the like, the sword fight sounds weren't quite as good. And, as another reviewer mentions, the bizarre laser effects when Gandalf uses his magic tend to put one more in mind of a Sci-Fi drama like War of the Worlds than a fantasy.Despite its flaws however, I'll always have a soft spot for both these Mind's Eye dramas, probably because they were my first real exposure to Tolkien's world. In fact if I hadn't misplaced them I would probably still dig them out and listen to them fairly often. The two stars are mainly subtracted for the rather scarce cast and some of the SFX. One thing I did really like were the wooden boxes that both The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings came in. Even a blind person like myself could feel the cool designs, probably writing, that were engraved into the wood. So while i'll admit that neither this program nor The Hobbit are as high quality as they could have been, I still enjoyed them enough to own them. I may have to reorder them at some point. Maybe when I have children and I decide to introduce them to the world of Middle Earth.",1,1
Applied Economics: Thinking Beyond Stage One,"The application of economics to major contemporary real world problems -- housing, medical care, discrimination, the economic development of nations -- is the theme of this new book that tackles these and other issues head on in plain language, as distinguished from the usual jargon of economists. It examines economic policies not simply in terms of their immediate effects but also in terms of their later repercussions, which are often very different and longer lasting. The interplay of politics with economics is another theme of Applied Economics, whose examples are drawn from experiences around the world, showing how similar incentives and constraints tend to produce similar outcomes among very disparate peoples and cultures.",['Thomas Sowell'],Hachette UK,2008,['Business & Economics'],4.0,5.0,2004-03-21,Must Read,"This book gives a great big picture look into the economics of many issues facing us today.

Jean Donaldson has written a brilliant textbook on operant conditioning, as well as what would have been a very useful training guide.The rub is that without an index, or even a detailed table of contents, if you want to find a behavior or a solution, or, for that matter, anything else, the only way to do it is to thumb through the entire book.The other day I was trying to find some interesting information I had seen in the book about the plusses and minuses of adding a second dog. I paged through the entire book, and found no chapter or section with the right heading. Then I went back and practically reread the entire first hundred pages until I found it buried in a section called ""Alone Training."" To add insult to injury, later in the book I found a statement to the effect that ""this has already been covered in 'Alone Training.'"" Aha! But where imight that be? You guessed it. The only way to find it is to page through the entire book, once again, to find the applicable section.I will go this far: In order for this book to be useful, as opposed to interesting, the reader would have to spend a few days (at least) making an index. Better yet, scan the entire book into a word recognition application so as to enable searches of the contents. But who is going to bother to do that?...",11,16
"Persuader (Jack Reacher, No. 7)","THE #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLING JACK REACHER SERIES THAT INSPIRED TWO MAJOR MOTION PICTURES AND THE UPCOMING STREAMING SERIES REACHER “Gripping and suspenseful . . . Child ratchets up the suspense to new heights.”—The Denver Post Jack Reacher lives for the moment. Without a home. Without commitment. And with a burning desire to right wrongs—and rewrite his own agonizing past. DEA Susan Duffy is living for the future, knowing that she has made a terrible mistake by putting one of her own female agents into a death trap within a heavily guarded Maine mansion. Staging a brilliant ruse, Reacher hurtles into the dark heart of a vast criminal enterprise. Trying to rescue an agent whose time is running out, Reacher enters a crime lord’s waterfront fortress. There he will find a world of secrecy and violence—and confront some unfinished business from his own past.",['Lee Child'],Delacorte Press,2003,['Fiction'],54.0,5.0,2006-04-28,More top-notch fiction from Lee Child,"A couple years ago, I was first introduced to Lee Child with Persuader and was impressed enough to start Child's Reacher series at the beginning. Having gone through all the earlier books, I figured I'd reread this novel before proceeding to the later books. Even as a re-read, this is a top-notch book and a reminder of why I've become a Lee Child fan.Persuader begins with Jack Reacher rescuing a college age kid from a kidnapping attempt. Soon enough, we find out that this is a ruse to get close to the boy's father, Zachary Beck. The FBI wants to shut Beck down; Reacher's more interested in Beck's business associate, a man Reacher knows as Quinn. But to get to Quinn, Reacher must first deal with gaining Beck's trust. There are additional complications as well, including a missing FBI agent and a murderous steroid-filled giant named Paulie.One of the first rules in suspense fiction is that if you think you killed someone, but you don't actually see his dead body, he's not really dead. Unfortunately for Reacher, he doesn't realize he's in a suspense novel, so even though ten years earlier, he shot Quinn three times and watched him fall over a cliff, he never saw the corpse, and Quinn did survive. Reacher is not a man who's very emotional, but the crimes that Quinn committed ate at him deeply; learning that Quinn is alive through a chance encounter reawakens his old feelings.Reacher is good at what he does, and so is Child. Although I'd read the book before and remembered many of the key plot points, this was still a good, suspenseful story. Child is able to make Reacher the almost ideal type of fictional action hero: one who is good at what he does (but is never cocky about it), intelligent, and is ethical without being preachy. Done improperly, a character like Reacher could be annoying, but Child never hits a wrong note. Since continuity is not too important with this series, this is as good a place as any to start (it's where I did), but if you like good suspense fiction, this is a must-read. Child is one of the best in the thriller genre.",1,2
Turn Off Your Mind: The Mystic Sixties and the Dark Side of the Age of Aquarius,"How did a decade that dawned with the Age of Aquarius end in Altamont and the Manson Family bloodbath? The 1960s were a time of revolution - political, social psychedelic, sexual. But there was another revolution that many historians forget the rise of a powerful current that permeated pop culture and has been a central influence on it ever since. It was a magical revolution - a revival of the occult. Previously rejected and ridiculed beliefs took centre stage, reaching the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, saturating the the hippies and flower power, hitting the big screen with Rosemary's Baby and the bookshelves with Lord of the Rings. The Tarot. I Ching, astrology, Kabbala, yogis, witchcraft, UFOs, Aleister Crowley. Yin Yang and the Tibetan Book of the Dead now became the common currency they are today. But the vibes went bad, the auras darkened. Did that darker undercurrent win out? Gary Lachman here charts this explosion, its rise and fall, and its enduring legacy --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",['Gary Lachman'],ReadHowYouWant.com,2011,[],4.0,1.0,2004-03-09,The Empire Strikes Back at the Sixties,"The subject is fascinating and needs more attention, but Lachman has an ax to grind. Is he disgruntled or just out for a buck? His criticism of the book ""The Morning of the Magicians"" in reality applies to THIS book. It is ""badly researched, poorly documented and full of inaccuracies"". Lachman's book is written in a superficial tabloid conspiracy buff style. You may recognize a phrase here, a phrase there, lifted from others.Lachman makes the most tenuous connections to build his argument. For example, Bobby Beausoleil wore a top hat (not unusual at the time). So did Mick Jagger on a concert tour. Therefore the Rolling Stones are connected with the Manson family. One use of the word ""magic"" is enough for him to label a writer as magical. He labels the Marxist philosopher Marcuse a Gnostic, who wanted to bring magic to politics. Lachman follows the common newspaper editorials of the day in equating student activism with Nazism. He also argues that occultism=Nazism and environmentalism=Nazism! He finds Anton LaVey's philosophy ""revolting"" although I doubt he knows anything about it. He supplies untruths, such as that LaVey had a ""dope-smoking lion"" and ""often appeared in the buff"" in girlie magazines.The book has a British slant, although he is unaware the Picts were not fictional. Some terms will be unfamiliar to Americans. He is unaware California has a long history of religious cults, and never mentions Ravi Shankar in a discussion of the sitar. The first 200 pages are hard to get though, as it is a historical survey through books - who wrote what, and who turned who on. Writing about Jack Parsons, he uses the term ""South Orange Grove Avenue"" for his house at least 8 times in 10 pages, and ""spit and image"" for ""spitting image"", showing the need for an editor.A final example - he feels the movie ""The Matrix"" continues the sixties tradition, and the characters wear black clothes, which Lachman terms a ""Gestapo-like dress code"". He's not simply being descriptive here, but equating the two. This type of guilt by remote association is the main current of the book.",80,97

This nugget of wisdom evolves as Catherine Ponder tells the story of a salesman whose standard response to the ""How's business"" question was always ""Business is wonderful because there's gold dust in the air!"" And for him there was. Because he said it was so, each contact resulted in sales and people always remarked of him, ""Everything he touches turns to gold.""According to Catherine Ponder the basic law of prosperity can be thought of as radiation and attraction: ""that what you radiate outward in your thoughts, feelings, mental pictures and words, you attract into your life and affairs."" But she goes on to explain that we don't get something for nothing; that we must give before we receive. Further, if you wish to enjoy more prosperity and success in life, you must ""boldly and deliberately take hold of your thoughts and feelings and redirect them toward prosperity and success.""The tools she gives us to achieve our own prosperity and success are sprinkled liberally throughout the entire book. It is a gold mine of powerful, pointed affirmations and poignant, real life stories that guide inspire and motivate action. Affirmations are a form of command Catherine advises; you make your world with words. ""Through verbally affirming or declaring the good you want, rather than continuing to talk about what you don't want, you begin to make firm in the mind and in the invisible ethers the good you desire. As you continue to affirm the desired good, it rushes forth as a visible result."" She also suggests writing lists and letters as practical, hands-on means to achieving goals and finding solutions to problems.Here is Catherine Ponder's Three-Step Formula for Prosperity:""First, daily write out your notes of desired good. Second, mentally image the successful results. Third, boldly and deliberately affirm and command those successful results to appear.

Primitive Wilderness Living and Survival Skills is a compilation of ten booklets written over the course of seven years each chapter a complete, concise ""how-to"" in itself.

Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking,"From the #1 bestselling author of The Bomber Mafia, the landmark book that has revolutionized the way we understand leadership and decision making. In his breakthrough bestseller The Tipping Point, Malcolm Gladwell redefined how we understand the world around us. Now, in Blink, he revolutionizes the way we understand the world within. Blink is a book about how we think without thinking, about choices that seem to be made in an instant--in the blink of an eye--that actually aren't as simple as they seem. Why are some people brilliant decision makers, while others are consistently inept? Why do some people follow their instincts and win, while others end up stumbling into error? How do our brains really work--in the office, in the classroom, in the kitchen, and in the bedroom? And why are the best decisions often those that are impossible to explain to others? In Blink we meet the psychologist who has learned to predict whether a marriage will last, based on a few minutes of observing a couple; the tennis coach who knows when a player will double-fault before the racket even makes contact with the ball; the antiquities experts who recognize a fake at a glance. Here, too, are great failures of ""blink"": the election of Warren Harding; ""New Coke""; and the shooting of Amadou Diallo by police. Blink reveals that great decision makers aren't those who process the most information or spend the most time deliberating, but those who have perfected the art of ""thin-slicing""--filtering the very few factors that matter from an overwhelming number of variables.",['Malcolm Gladwell'],Back Bay Books,2007,['Business & Economics'],3948.0,5.0,2008-12-21,great book!,"I'm not quite done with the book but it is so interesting!

Darkfever (Fever Series),"MacKayla Lane’s life is good. She has great friends, a decent job, and a car that breaks down only every other week or so. In other words, she’s your perfectly ordinary twenty-first-century woman. Or so she thinks . . . until something extraordinary happens. When her sister is murdered, leaving a single clue to her death—a cryptic message on Mac’s cell phone—Mac journeys to Ireland in search of answers. The quest to find her sister’s killer draws her into a shadowy realm where nothing is as it seems, where good and evil wear the same treacherously seductive mask. She is soon faced with an even greater challenge: staying alive long enough to learn how to handle a power she had no idea she possessed–a gift that allows her to see beyond the world of man, into the dangerous realm of the Fae. . . . As Mac delves deeper into the mystery of her sister’s death, her every move is shadowed by the dark, mysterious Jericho, a man with no past and only mockery for a future. As she begins to close in on the truth, the ruthless Vlane—an alpha Fae who makes sex an addiction for human women–closes in on her. And as the boundary between worlds begins to crumble, Mac’s true mission becomes clear: find the elusive Sinsar Dubh before someone else claims the all-powerful Dark Book—because whoever gets to it first holds nothing less than complete control of the very fabric of both worlds in their hands. . . .

At first he resists the LAPD shrink, but finally recognizes that something is troubling him and has for a long time.

The Dragon Reborn: Book Three of 'The Wheel of Time',"The Wheel of Time is now an original series on Prime Video, starring Rosamund Pike as Moiraine! In The Dragon Reborn, the third novel in Robert Jordan’s #1 New York Times bestselling epic fantasy series, The Wheel of Time®, Rand al’Thor undertakes a journey to prove himself worthy of being the Champion of Light. Winter has stopped the war—almost—yet men are dying, calling out for the Dragon. But where is he? Rand al’Thor has been proclaimed the Dragon Reborn. Traveling to the great fortress known as the Stone of Tear, he plans to find the sword Callandor, which can only be wielded by the Champion of Light, and discover if he truly is destined to battle The Dark One. Following Rand, Moiraine and their friends battle Darkhounds on the hunt, hoping they reach the Heart of the Stone in time for the next great test awaiting the Dragon Reborn. Since its debut in 1990, The Wheel of Time® by Robert Jordan has captivated millions of readers around the globe with its scope, originality, and compelling characters. The last six books in series were all instant #1 New York Times bestsellers, and The Eye of the World was named one of America's best-loved novels by PBS's The Great American Read.

However, in the third book of Robert Jordan's epic fantasy series, everything heats up.The book is mostly told from the POVs of Egwene, Perrin, and Mat. Those three characters pretty much divide the books between themselves, each having between 25 and 33 percent of the book. Rand sets off on a quest to find and recover the legendary sword Callandor, a weapon that will multiply his already considerable powers, basically rendering him an unstoppable demi-god who will be able to trounce the Forsaken and other servants of the Dark One easily. Only glimpses are seen of him during this endeavor: Meanwhile, Perrin chases after Rand with Moiraine, Lan, and a crazy girl they meet along the way. Egwene remains at the White Tower with Elayne and bitchnaeve, searching the tower for the Black Ajah. Mat, after finally being released from his curse, heads to Andor, and afterwards for Tear. Eventually, the various POVs converge in the capital city of Tear, where the crystal sword is hidden inside a vast fortress the size of a small mountain.The lessening of the focus of Rand-who had about third-quarters of the first book and half of the second to himself-gives Jordan the opportunity to develop the rest of the characters, an opportunity that he definitely doesn't waste. There are a few negative things that can be said about the Wheel of Time, especially later on, but not giving sufficient attention to every character and subplot is not one of them.The pace of the story tightens in The Dragon Reborn, the world is developed further, the characters continue to develop and reveal their various personalities(though I must say Nynaeve has fallen behind in this regard; she is and remains little more than a stubborn, bullying idiot), old questions are answered and new ones are raised, the dialogue is much better than in the Great Hunt, and the plot and resolution are the strongest yet in the series. The story is well-structured and advances towards a definite culmination point, where the various separate stories converge in an excellent finish. The intense magical duel in the final chapters is spectacular, with the only problem being that it ended too soon.The Wheel of Time has it's moments, but this book boasts the best one yet when Egwene is in Tel'aran'rhiod: She encounters Rand and attempts to subdue him with the One Power when he dismisses her as a disguised enemy. Seconds later, Egwene gets owned and forced to retreat. Priceless. What I'd like to see now is Rand do the same thing to Nynaeve. Other memorable moments include: Mat's epic duel against two swordsman with only a quarterstaff, the massive Sa'angreal-powered healing scene, the Aiel showcasing their deadly fighting styles at several points, Rand conjuring the fantasy-equivalent of a lightsaber and slicing an assailant to bits, Mat's incredible gambling exploits, and the triumphant moment where Rand holds Callandor and accepts himself as the Dragon Reborn.One thing I'll admit I'm annoyed with is that my two favorite characters, Rand and Elayne, don't really have much in the way of their own POVs. At least there wasn't much for Nynaeve, either.Jordan corrects about half of the problems within the Wheel of Time in this book, and plays to his own strengths, namely good prose, a fine attention to detail, strong characters, an interesting and complex magic system, and excellent worldbuilding. Though the pacing could be better, the story itself is awe-inspiring. Few fantasy series are as epic as the Wheel of Time, with such an expansive and ambitious scope.The central theme of this book seems to be Rand's ascension to a higher position and acceptance of his new role. Starting in this book, he sheds his old persona as a common shepherd and picks up the sword(literally and figuratively) of the Dragon Reborn, the breaker of nations, the enemy of the Dark One, the most powerful channeler ever born, and the world's only hope. As previously mentioned, the final scene where Rand holds Callandor is incredible. Even though he has relatively little time, Rand's role is undoubtedly the centerpiece of this book.I'd consider this point, at the Dragon Reborn, to be the beginning of the ""Golden Age"" of the Wheel of Time, when the series is at it's best and before it starts to go downhill. It, and the following books, are fantastic paradigms of epic fiction.4.5 stars.",1,1

The Emerald Tablets of Thoth The Atlantean,"The Spiritual, Occult and Historical significance of the ""Emerald Tablets"" is almost beyond belief of modern man.

The powerful and rhythmic verse of Thoth is wonderfully retained in Doreal's translation. Contained within the pages of Thoth's masterpiece of Spiritual and Occult Wisdom is the synthesis of the Ancient Wisdom Teachings, the guideline for initiates of all ages, revealing the Knowledge and Wisdom hitherto held secret, but now in this New Age, revealed to all Seekers on the Path of Light.

Honestly, I don't read much book but I'm glad that I read this one.Throughout the first and most of the second volumes, Eliza criticized Mr. Darcy for his conceited, haughty attitude. She berated him for being so snobby at the balls. Eliza made assumptions about Mr. Darct only using his appearance and brief conversations with him as her premise. She also believed rumors from absolute strangers (Mr. Wickham) that slandered Mr. Darcy's reputation. Any bad news that she could find even the most baised resource was a good enough for her, just as long as it intensified her hatred for Darcy. One of the greatest accusations she put against him was his acts of prejudce and his big pride. However, she had made these conclusions based on her own prejudce against Darcy. This is the irony. She was a hypocrite in her own way. She deserves equal censure for her pride and prejudice. Unfortunately she realized her defects at near end. It is not surprisng that hse feels horrible about her discovery of her true self. The irony in all of this is that she got so caught up in finding Darcy's evil that she became who she hated most. She became the vain and prejudced one. She became the enemy she loathed so much. As you can plainly see, this book had a lot of impact on me. It was really enriching to read and Austen's delicate use of language which integrates the formality of that time along with slight English humor. The amalgam of languages helped me develop an intense vocabulary. I learned a lot of new words and feel better about writing.",3,3
Language Truth and Logic,"""A delightful book … I should like to have written it myself."" — Bertrand Russell First published in 1936, this first full-length presentation in English of the Logical Positivism of Carnap, Neurath, and others has gone through many printings to become a classic of thought and communication. It not only surveys one of the most important areas of modern thought; it also shows the confusion that arises from imperfect understanding of the uses of language. A first-rate antidote for fuzzy thought and muddled writing, this remarkable book has helped philosophers, writers, speakers, teachers, students, and general readers alike. Mr. Ayers sets up specific tests by which you can easily evaluate statements of ideas. You will also learn how to distinguish ideas that cannot be verified by experience — those expressing religious, moral, or aesthetic experience, those expounding theological or metaphysical doctrine, and those dealing with a priori truth. The basic thesis of this work is that philosophy should not squander its energies upon the unknowable, but should perform its proper function in criticism and analysis.",['Alfred Jules Ayer'],Courier Corporation,2012,['Philosophy'],6.0,5.0,2000-05-11,The book that destroyed Positivism,"A brief, elegant classic that shows that the major questions in philosophy need not be unintelligible to the public. I was handed a copy of this book back in grad school. I was majoring in physiological psychology, but I used to drink with philosophers, as they provided a nice counterpoint to the philisophiocal stance of my teachers. At the time I found myself entranced with positivism, something that happens to all students of the sciences sooner or later. On the surface positivism promises quite a lot, not the least of which is the idea that it provides a truely *scientific* approach to knowledge and belief. I was all set to approach the mind in a purely mechanical way when my friend Patrick gave me a copy of Ayre's little book.A little historical background: At the time ""Language, Truth and Logic"" was written, positivism was the hot topic in the philosophical world, and had adherents far beyond philosophy alone- for instance, in psychology, the Behaviorists, led by John Watson, were developing a positivist theory of psychology- a view that still has its strong adherents.What Ayre discovered in his meetings with Positivists was that Positivism contained the seeds of its own destruction- it could not itself pass the tests it proposed for a theory of knowledge. So I read Ayre. I thought about the argument, and the more I thought about it, the clearer it seemed. I couldn't come up with a decent counterargument. In the end, I rejected positivism, decided there was more to psychology than mere behavior, and switched my major to cognitive psychology. Quite an accomplishment for such a slim volume.",0,0

This science fiction story of a Utopian society is a must read. This story was set in the future when it was written. It begins in ""civilization"" where everyone is always happy. You are ""conditioned"" or taught since you were little to be this way. You have no choice in what to do with your life, or what your social status will be. That is all decided before you are ""decanted"" or born. The ""world controller says it best when he says, ""...The world's stable now. People are happy; they get what they want, ant they never want what they can't get. They're well off; they're safe; they're never ill; they're not afraid of death; they're blissfully ignorant of passion and old age; they're plagued with no mothers or fathers' they've got no wives, or children, or lovers to feel strongly about; they're so conditioned that they practically can't help behaving as they ought to behave.""The main characters are Bernard Marx and Lenina Crowne. This story follows their relationship, and that of people they meet. They start out dating and go on vacation together. For this vacation, they go to the one place where life is still like it is now. They find something that is completely different than anything that they have ever seen. It throws the whole society for a loop.On a scale of one to ten I would give this book a nine. There were still some things that I was unsure of when I finished, and it seemed to just end abruptly, but over all, it was a good read. I would highly recommend it. It kept me interested, and was not too long or difficult to read. If you can make it through the first fifty pages, which use a lot of scientific terms, then I can guarantee that you will not be bored.",1,2

The author's constant generalizations, like the ""Indian voice can bring rain"" -or something to that effect, is really weird. Gee, I'm half ""Indian"" and I can't go outside and make it rain, too bad. But really, the mixture of buddhism, ""newage"" crystal magic, and minute elements of Cherokee teachings mislead readers into thinking that all the information presented in this book is Cherokee practice. I could not read this entire story because most of it is false and it just made me sad and angry. I can't believe that people can be so gullable and misinformed that they believe that anything that claims to be ""Indian"" really is. This book should not even be allowed to be sold, that's how false it is. Maybe it is because of books like these that people do not have any clue who the Cherokee, and the hundreds of other nations, really are. So, this author's broad generalizations that all ""Indians"" are the same, that we are all in harmony with nature, that we all can do this magical stuff just naturally, are sickening and in no way do they represent anyone but the author. I am an individual with free will (in other words I am human), nature does not rule my life (Indians have difficulty finding time to recycle too), and I do not have special magical powers that allow me to control my environment or the natural world. Ywahoo is a fruad, and you can find proof of this. I am not going to say thank you, just regretfully a reader. P.S. -It is impossible to rate this book as zero stars, but if I could I would.",9,17

My War: Killing Time in Iraq,"'Once we passed the checkpoint at the border, it hit me. I was like, Holy Shit, this is it, I'm entering a combat zone. Cool!' At twenty-six Colby Buzzell, unemployed and living at home, decided to join the US Army. Within months he was in Iraq, a machine gunner in the controversial Stryker Brigade Combat Team, an army unit on the cutting edge of combat technology and the first of its kind. Trapped amid 'guerrilla warfare, urban-style' in Mosul, Iraq, Buzzell was struck by the bizarre and often frightening world surrounding him. He began writing a blog describing the war - not as being reported by CNN or official briefings - but as experienced by the soldier on the ground. His story is a brutally honest and hard-hitting account of the absurdities of modern war. These are the real stories of the war: a firefight where the resistance came from 'men in black'; a night spent chain-smoking in the guard tower counting the tracer bullets being fired over the city; and the hesitation of a young soldier who had been passed around from platoon to platoon because he was too afraid to fight.

Ahhhh, such a tale that everyone loves. Who doesn't have a favorite character (or two). However, this review deals with the book that the movie was developed from.The book of The Princess Bride is self described as the abridged telling of S. Morgenstern's classic tale of true love and high adventure. However, rather than being an abridged story, this is the full story (sorry if you're looking for Morgenstern's tale, a little lie). That said, the tale is told as a writer who's abridging a classic tale from his youth that his dad read to him when he was sick. In `abridging' Morgenstern's work, Mr. Goldman inserts his own comments, whether it's his memory of when his dad read the story to him or when he explains why he removed part of Morgentstern's work.The GoodThe book follows the movie (or is it the movie follows the book, a little hard to say) very well. All of the scenes you love in the movie are in the book. Additional data is provided usually, but it doesn't hurt what we saw in the movie in the least. In addition, we're given additional back ground data on Princess Buttercup, Wesley, and all of the major characters. I was particularly happy with the additional information on Inigo and Fezzik. While I enjoyed them in the movie, the book brings them forward! Especially when you learn what Fezzik went thru.The BadSometimes Mr. Goldman is a little long winded. I know he was trying to capture a writing style, but I think he took it a little to far. Particularly when describing the Prince and his Zoo of Death. As a matter of fact, this caused me to put the book down for a little while.The RatingBoy, on the front half I was only thinking 3 stars. I mean it was a little slow, Mr. Goldman spent a fair amount of time coming up with the idea of abridging the book, acquiring the book, and writing the abridged work. However, once Princess Buttercup is kidnapped the story picks up and the story steps up to 4.5 stars. Given this, I'll call this one a 4 star book. The strength of the book is what we've seen in the movie, quick action with an excellent story that everyone loves.",4,4

"Immortality, Resurrection and the Age of the Universe: A Kabbalistic View","The late Aryeh Kaplan was one of the most creative personalities to bless the Jewish scene in the last generation. At his death he left many unpublished articles and other works. This collection contains some of his most provocative insights, combining ancient Kabbalistic teaching with the discoveries of modern science. Among the topics covered in this volume are such basic concepts as the Jewish and Kabbalistic view of immortality, resurrection of the dead, the age of the universe, and astrology. All are published for the first time. The book also includes a translation of Rabbi Israel Lipschitz' 1845 article on resurrection, which deals in part with the paleontological discoveries of the first half of the nineteenth century.

This book covers the following topics: The age of the universe, longevity and immortality, resurrection, stars and angels, and male &amp; female. Kaplan has much of interest to say about these topics, including some truly eye-opening ideas. Included in this book are translations of essays from an early kabbalistic sage, Isaac of Acco, and an important 19th century scholar, Israel Lipshitz on the great antiquity of the earth.

Mazes and Monsters,"Part thriller, part love story, Mazes and Monsters is a spellbinding novel about a group of college students in the 1980s who use a fantasy game as refuge from their personal, emotional, and social problems. Based loosely on the “steam tunnel incidents” of the 1970s, the four friends—Kate, Jay Jay, Daniel, and Robbie—eventually take their game too far when they decide to live-action role-play in the caverns near their college campus.

Granted, I haven't re-read it recently, but I disagree with some of the other, more-negative reviews.I actually liked the character sketches that Jaffe used. Finding out about the characters' backgrounds, and those of their parents, did a good job of showing how they became the people they are in the present. And where some of their individual problems came from.With regards to the social events that were going on at the time that this book was written, I have a few thoughts. What many ""protect the child"" groups miss--whether they're attacking heavy metal music, Dungeons and Dragons, or Harry Potter--is that people don't do bad things because of a book or a song. They do so because they make a conscious choice to act badly. And they arrive at this decision more as a result of their poor upbringing (not being taught right from wrong, plus concern for others) and their current environment (being bullied, being pressured to be an ""A"" student) than anything else.""Mazes and Monsters"" points out that the character of Robbie had problems before he played the game. And if it wasn't the game that acted as the catalyst for his break from reality, it would've been something else.That's something I think that everybody missed.",7,8

His weird and wonderful future universe is entirely his own, and these key short stories illuminate various important points and events in its unfolding history. &quot;Mother Hitton's Littul Kittons&quot; shows the reader, by truly horrific example, why it is a very bad idea to try and rob the richest planet in the galaxy. The story of Joan of Arc is retold in &quot;The Dead Lady of Clown Town&quot; from a point of view taking place several centuries after the actual incident, so that the reader may compare famous paintings and poetic reconstructions with the real events. In &quot;Drunkboat&quot; a young man travels through the terrible poetry of Space-3 to reach the planet where his love lies dying; &quot;A Planet Named Shayol&quot; is about hell and people and the drug known as super-condamine. &quot;The Ballad of Lost C'mell&quot; is my single favorite piece of science fiction, so anything I say about it is going to be biased: read it for yourself. All five stories can be found in collections of Smith's work, such as &quot;The Rediscovery of Man&quot; or &quot;The Instrumentality of Mankind,&quot; but &quot;Space Lords&quot; has an added bonus: a preface and afterword by Cordwainer Smith himself. As he died in 1966-far too early, by this reader's reckoning!-it's a strange sensation feeling that the author is speaking directly to his audience. But it's great. Read &quot;Space Lords&quot; if you can find it, both for its stories and for its glimpse into Cordwainer Smith the writer (it's a pseudonym, of course, but that's not the point) and his own comments on his writing.

But at the age of seven, Rachel and her dreams are shattered by the discovery that she has leprosy. Forcibly removed from her family, she is sent to Kalaupapa, the isolated leper colony on the island of Moloka'i.

Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig,"The definitive account of the life and tragic death of baseball legend Lou Gehrig. Lou Gehrig was a baseball legend—the Iron Horse, the stoic New York Yankee who was the greatest first baseman in history, a man whose consecutive-games streak was ended by a horrible disease that now bears his name. But as this definitive new biography makes clear, Gehrig’s life was more complicated—and, perhaps, even more heroic—than anyone really knew. Drawing on new interviews and more than two hundred pages of previously unpublished letters to and from Gehrig, Luckiest Man gives us an intimate portrait of the man who became an American hero: his life as a shy and awkward youth growing up in New York City, his unlikely friendship with Babe Ruth (a friendship that allegedly ended over rumors that Ruth had had an affair with Gehrig’s wife), and his stellar career with the Yankees, where his consecutive-games streak stood for more than half a century. What was not previously known, however, is that symptoms of Gehrig’s affliction began appearing in 1938, earlier than is commonly acknowledged. Later, aware that he was dying, Gehrig exhibited a perseverance that was truly inspiring; he lived the last two years of his short life with the same grace and dignity with which he gave his now-famous “luckiest man” speech. Meticulously researched and elegantly written, Jonathan Eig’s Luckiest Man shows us one of the greatest baseball players of all time as we’ve never seen him before.",['Jonathan Eig'],Simon and Schuster,2010,['Biography & Autobiography'],12.0,5.0,2006-04-25,What A Book! What A Man!,"Luckiest Man by Jonathan Eig provides an engrossing, encompassing portrait of Lou Gehrig -- a complex man who despite his many insecurities became one of baseball's and America's finest heroes. Eig presents it all, ranging from Gehrig's growing up with a very domineering mother, to his humbleness and constant self-doubt despite his many outstanding achievements, to his relationships with his teammates and especially Babe Ruth, to his desire to let his actions rather than his mouth promote his abilities, to his relationship with women and his wife, and finally to his courage in battling the disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (more commonly known as Lou Gehrig's Disease), that he contracted at the zenith of his careed and that ultimately took his life at the young age of thirty-six. Eig's skill as a writer is demonstrated by his ability to make you want to stay glued to your seat while absorbing a wealth of information about this fascinating man. You don't have to be a baseball fan to enjoy Luckiest Man -- just a person who enjoys learning about a man who deservedly has become an American icon.",4,4

9-11,Provides the final report of the 9/11 Commission detailing their findings on the September 11 terrorist attacks.,['National Commission on Terrorist Attacks upon the United States'],W. W. Norton & Company,2004,['Political Science'],6.0,4.0,2002-08-31,Challenging stereotyping,"Chomsky&#65533;s credentials in analysing terrorism and international politics are unimpeachable. In this series of interviews, conducted by various international journalists, he demonstrates his knowledgeable grasp of the realities of ""terrorism."" From the outset, he makes clear that definitions of ""terrorism"" must include the United States with its history of state-supported acts in various countries, most particularly in the Middle East. He makes us aware that the Middle East population is cognizant of American activities there, even as the bulk of the American public is not. He steadfastly refutes the belief, held by many American intellectuals, that the World Trade Centre attacks are due to resentment over the American push for a ""globalized economy.""Chomsky recognizes that the WTC attacks were unique - never before had an assault been carried out directly on American territory. Pearl Harbour cannot be equated with the 9/11 attack. He cautions that the attacks were not carried out at the direction of a foreign nation. There is no state of war with another country, and the term ""war on terror"" is merely political sophistry. Nor, as he reminds his interviewers, is Amerika alone in its negative impact in the Middle East and elsewhere. Each of his interviewers is reminded of the history of their nations in colonial and post-colonial eras.Amerikan machinations were designed to foster the very forces opposed to them now. Saudi Arabia has been a ""client state"" of the US since its founding. The Taliban were supported so long as they represented anti-Soviet policies in Afghanistan. And that personification of Evil, Saddam Hussein was provided with weapons, advice and money in his campaign against the Ayatollah&#65533;s Iraq. He stresses the inconsistencies in Amerikan policies. When Oklahoma City&#65533;s bombing occurred and militia groups in Montana and Idaho were identified as likely funders, why weren&#65533;t those states bombed and their governments deposed? Equally, Britain would have been justified in bombing Boston, a major source of funds for the IRA.What, then, is Chomsky&#65533;s recommended course of action? He reminds us that the United States is the only nation that has been reprimanded by the World Court for acts of terrorism against Nicaragua. Although the United States ""dismissed that court&#65533;s judgement with contempt,"" Chomsky argues for adherence to international agreements and conventions. He recognizes the Sisyphisian task this presents, but hopes good reporting to the wider public will result in international pressure to bring it about. He knows the American public must be led away from the political rhetoric. These interviews are designed to provide help with that first step to better knowledge and understanding.The format of this book, a collection of interviews taken over a brief period after the attacks, inevitably result in brevity and repetition. Chomsky is not given opportunity to present resources, although his contentions are ably supported by material in the bibliography. These recount acts and policies undertaken in your name and using Amerikan tax dollars. While the change of approach he recommends entails an epic change in mind-set, the revision is neither impossible nor impractical. He stresses that we all need to live together, and unilateral policies will result in greater expense and increased loss of lives. Neither result is practical nor desirable. It takes only political will, supported by the population of the world&#65533;sgreatest democracy, to enable it.",22,37

We meet Pip as he describes his sister who &quot;raised him by hand.&quot; However, despite his misgivings about his sister he still feels very fondly towards his brother-in-law Joe Gargery. He meets many extraordinary characters along the way one of them being the classic literary figure Miss Havsiham. Miss Havisham had a broken heart and she raised her daughter Estealla to view men the same way she did. As Pip grows up and moves out on his own he becomes the only person to know the true identity of Estella. The other important character in &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is a criminal. He had threatened Pip in the marshes when he was a young boy and came back from New Zealand many years later to see Pip again. All though the criminal meets his untimely demise we still grow close to the character and miss him when he goes.

It takes you on a journey that provides you with many lessons that can be carried throughout your life.

David Brin is worried, but not just about privacy. He fears that society will overreact to these technologies by restricting the flow of information, frantically enforcing a reign of secrecy. Such measures, he warns, won't really preserve our privacy. Governments, the wealthy, criminals, and the techno-elite will still find ways to watch us. But we'll have fewer ways to watch them. We'll lose the key to a free society: accountability.The Transparent Society is a call for “reciprocal transparency.” If police cameras watch us, shouldn't we be able to watch police stations? If credit bureaus sell our data, shouldn't we know who buys it? Rather than cling to an illusion of anonymity-a historical anomaly, given our origins in close-knit villages-we should focus on guarding the most important forms of privacy and preserving mutual accountability. The biggest threat to our freedom, Brin warns, is that surveillance technology will be used by too few people, now by too many.A society of glass houses may seem too fragile. Fearing technology-aided crime, governments seek to restrict online anonymity; fearing technology-aided tyranny, citizens call for encrypting all data. Brins shows how, contrary to both approaches, windows offer us much better protection than walls; after all, the strongest deterrent against snooping has always been the fear of being spotted. Furthermore, Brin argues, Western culture now encourages eccentricity-we're programmed to rebel! That gives our society a natural protection against error and wrong-doing, like a body's immune system. But “social T-cells” need openness to spot trouble and get the word out. The Transparent Society is full of such provocative and far-reaching analysis.The inescapable rush of technology is forcing us to make new choices about how we want to live. This daring book reminds us that an open society is more robust and flexible than one where secrecy reigns. In an era of gnat-sized cameras, universal databases, and clothes-penetrating radar, it will be more vital than ever for us to be able to watch the watchers. With reciprocal transparency we can detect dangers early and expose wrong-doers. We can gauge the credibility of pundits and politicians. We can share technological advances and news. But all of these benefits depend on the free, two-way flow of information.",['David Brin'],Basic Books,1999,['History'],6.0,2.0,2007-06-30,Do not be fooled,"This author steeps his product with an endorsement of our loss of rights, privacy, and freedom.

To kill a mockingbird,"Voted America's Best-Loved Novel in PBS's The Great American Read Harper Lee's Pulitzer Prize-winning masterwork of honor and injustice in the deep South—and the heroism of one man in the face of blind and violent hatred One of the most cherished stories of all time, To Kill a Mockingbird has been translated into more than forty languages, sold more than forty million copies worldwide, served as the basis for an enormously popular motion picture, and was voted one of the best novels of the twentieth century by librarians across the country. A gripping, heart-wrenching, and wholly remarkable tale of coming-of-age in a South poisoned by virulent prejudice, it views a world of great beauty and savage inequities through the eyes of a young girl, as her father—a crusading local lawyer—risks everything to defend a black man unjustly accused of a terrible crime.",['Harper Lee'],Harper Collins,2014,['Fiction'],2164.0,4.0,2005-01-05,tHe CoOl ReViEw On To KiLl A mOcKiNgBiRd,"I thought this was a really great book. I was totally exciting with alot of action. There is no wonder that it has gotten so many awards. Some things that I liked about To Kill A Mockingbird are the accents of the characters. Some things things I didn't like about it was the ending. I would definately reccommend it to anyone who is mature enough to understand the complexity of the novel. My favorite character is Scout because she is so innocent and she speaks her mind. Harper Lee brought up the subject of racism in a very unique manner. I case you don't want to read the book, you could always watch the movie which is also excellant and sticks to the plot very closely. I think that To Kill A Mockingbird deserves 4 1/2 stars, but unfortunately you can't do that on this website so I made it 4 stars! Thank-you! Bye!",0,0

"The Black Dahlia Files: The Mob, the Mogul, and the Murder That Transfixed Los Angeles","In 1946, Elizabeth Short traveled to Hollywood to become famous and see her name up in lights. Instead, the dark-haired beauty became immortalized in the headlines as the ""Black Dahlia"" when her nude and bisected body was discovered in the weeds of a vacant lot. Despite the efforts of more than four hundred police officers and homicide investigators, the heinous crime was never solved. Now, after endless speculation and false claims, bestselling author Donald H. Wolfe discovers startling new evidence—buried in the files of the Los Angeles District Attorney's Office for more than half a century. With the aid of archival photos, news clippings, and investigative reports, Wolfe documents the riveting untold story that names the brutal murderer—the notorious Mafia leader, Benjamin ""Bugsy"" Siegel—and the motive—an unwanted pregnancy resulting from Short's involvement with the most powerful figure in Los Angeles, Norman Chandler. But Wolfe goes even further to unravel the large-scale cover-up behind the case. Wolfe's extensive research, based on the evidence he discovered in the recently opened LADA files, makes The Black Dahlia Files the authoritative work on the murder that has drawn endless scrutiny but remained unsolved—until now.",['Don Wolfe'],HarperCollins,2022,['True Crime'],1.0,3.0,2010-04-25,WHOLE PREMISE OF BOOK FALLS APART BECAUSE....,"The autopsy states ""that Short was not and had never been pregnant"", also in Severed by John Gilmore, when Elizabeth was in San Diego just before she was murdered she would ask the boy Cory, son of Dorothy French to buy ""sanitary napkins"" and other items for her, does this sound like she was pregnant?

"Laduma!: Soccer, Politics and Society in South Africa","In South Africa there are times when nothing is more important than soccer (football). Laduma! is an immensely informative and vital account of the history of the game in South Africa. In explaining how soccer - a sport imported with colonialism - came to be a mainstay of black sporting experience, it explores the Africanization of the game with the introduction of rituals and magic, and the emergence of distinctive playing styles. Using archival research, interviews, newspaper and magazine articles, advertisements and photos, Laduma! chronicles the impact of indigenous sporting traditions such as stick fighting, the rise of Orlando Pirates, the emergence of rivals Moroka Swallows, and the power struggles between different football associations and white authorities. Soccer influenced class and generational divisions, shaped masculine identities, and served as a mobilizing force for township and political organizations.

THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA,"The Phantom of the Opera is a novel by French writer Gaston Leroux. Christine Daaé travels with her father, a famous fiddler, throughout Europe, and plays folk and religious music. When Christine was six years old, her mother died and her father was taken to rural France by a patron, Professor Valerius. While Christine was a child, her father told her many stories about the ""Angel of Music"", who is the personification of musical inspiration. Christine meets and befriends the young Raoul, Viscount of Chagny. One of Christine and Raoul's favourite stories is one of Little Lotte, a girl who is visited by the Angel of Music and possesses a heavenly voice. Christine now lives with ""Mamma"" Valerius, the elderly widow of her father's benefactor. She eventually is given a position in the chorus at the Paris Opera House (Palais Garnier). She begins hearing a beautiful, unearthly voice which sings to her and speaks to her. She believes this must be the Angel of Music and asks him if he is. The Voice agrees and offers to teach her ""a little bit of heaven's music"". The Voice, however, belongs to Erik, a physically deformed and mentally disturbed musical genius who was one of the architects who took part in the construction of the opera house. He is in love with Christine.",['Gaston Leroux'],BookRix,2019,['Fiction'],3.0,5.0,2005-01-30,An Essential for any Phan...,"This is the third translation of Gaston Leroux's The Phantom of the Opera that I have purchased, and I don't regret it. Most of us are familiar with the ""official"" translation - the one that is the tie-in for the musical (and countless other editions). Leonard Wolf gives us a newer and - as he feels - more faithful interpretation of the French text. (Sidenote: In the tie-in translation, the Phantom never refers to himself as the Phantom: only as the Opera Ghost, or O.G. In this version, he is always the more musical Phantom of the Opera.)If you have not read Phantom yet, you may be a bit distracted by the voluminous footnotes. For the familiar reader however, the footnotes are the main reason to buy this edition. Wolf provides valuable insight into many areas of the text. He points out inconsistencies: Raoul goes from being 21 to 20. He provides commentary on the mythological allusions in the text.Most valuable, he provides artistic commentary on the book. He shows how Phantom fits into Gothic conventions: the damsel-in-distress being menaced by a sexually threatening outsider, only to be rescued by a non-sexual aristocrat. But it is not quite that simple; Wolf shows that there are only two protagonists in the piece: Christine and Erik. He rightly shows Raoul for the foolish little sap that he is. He thinks that Leroux intended it to be that way, and that Christine has a much stronger bond with Erik than she does Raoul.On the whole, I wish Wolf had written more. How about interpretive essays on the various adaptations, including the Lloyd Weber musical? He does include a lengthy introduction about the novel and Gaston Leroux himself. This volume is a must-have for any Phantom-enthusiast.",91,94

Interpreter of Maladies (Highbridge Distribution),"FINALIST FOR THE 2017 NATIONAL BOOK AWARD FOR FICTION Named a Best Book of 2017 by NPR, Entertainment Weekly, the Los Angeles Times, BuzzFeed, Bustle, and Electric Literature “There was a time I would have called Lisa Ko’s novel beautifully written, ambitious, and moving, and all of that is true, but it’s more than that now: if you want to understand a forgotten and essential part of the world we live in, The Leavers is required reading.” —Ann Patchett, author of Commonwealth Lisa Ko’s powerful debut, The Leavers, is the winner of the 2016 PEN/Bellwether Prize for Fiction, awarded by Barbara Kingsolver for a novel that addresses issues of social justice. One morning, Deming Guo’s mother, Polly, an undocumented Chinese immigrant, goes to her job at a nail salon—and never comes home. No one can find any trace of her. With his mother gone, eleven-year-old Deming is left mystified and bereft. Eventually adopted by a pair of well-meaning white professors, Deming is moved from the Bronx to a small town upstate and renamed Daniel Wilkinson. But far from all he’s ever known, Daniel struggles to reconcile his adoptive parents’ desire that he assimilate with his memories of his mother and the community he left behind. Told from the perspective of both Daniel—as he grows into a directionless young man—and Polly, Ko’s novel gives us one of fiction’s most singular mothers. Loving and selfish, determined and frightened, Polly is forced to make one heartwrenching choice after another. Set in New York and China, The Leavers is a vivid examination of borders and belonging. It’s a moving story of how a boy comes into his own when everything he loves is taken away, and how a mother learns to live with the mistakes of the past.",['Lisa Ko'],Algonquin Books,2018,['Fiction'],31.0,5.0,2001-10-30,Simply Elegant,"Ms. Lahiri's stories seem to be simple tales of everyday life until they take an unexpected turn.

How to Talk to a Liberal (If You Must): The World According to Ann Coulter,"The conservative columnist shares her thoughts on topics from political correctness and foreign policy to the media, in a collection of her commentaries accompanied by responses from readers on both sides of the political spectrum.",['Ann Coulter'],Crown Forum,2005,['Political Science'],9.0,5.0,2006-11-03,A minefield for democrats and liberals.......,"If you are not familiar with Ann Coulter then be forewarned - she's definitely a conservative!!. As an author, Ann is smart, original and makes repeated use of the literary element we call SATIRE. As far as the book goes I liked it and give it 5 stars but the title might not be the most appropriate. In essence the book is a compilation of her views of semi-current events and her attempt to bring light to things which, in her opinion, were twisted or omitted from the record. In that regard, I found the book very enlightening and learned things I never knew about the tailhook incident, Bill Clinton and a host of other issues. For me, this book was a reminder of why I sided with the conservatives long ago. If you are a moderate or a conservative I think you will like the book. If you are a democrat you will probably decide the book's best use is as kindling for the fireplace.... but then again, it may cause you to rethink your views.",16,28
Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill),"In a timely update of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, National Book Award finalist Ibi Zoboi skillfully balances cultural identity, class, and gentrification against the heady magic of first love in her vibrant reimagining of this beloved classic. A smart, funny, gorgeous retelling starring all characters of color. Zuri Benitez has pride. Brooklyn pride, family pride, and pride in her Afro-Latino roots.

She especially can’t stand the judgmental and arrogant Darius. Yet as Zuri and Darius are forced to find common ground, their initial dislike shifts into an unexpected understanding.

My grands were 3 and 5 when we got this book and they loved it, one boy, one girl. They laughed and claimed their corresponding characters in the book.

The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,"The off-beat and occasionally extraterrestrial journeys, notions, and acquaintances of galactic traveler Arthur Dent are illustrated with digitally generated graphic images and tricky visual puns",['Douglas Adams'],Harmony,1994,['Science'],2.0,1.0,2001-10-03,Waste of Time,"My initial reaction to The Hitchhiker&#8217;s Guide to the Galaxy was that Douglas Adams tries to mask the book&#8217;s sheer stupidity and lack of plot with big words and other nonsense that seem to be attempts at humor. The novel was completely devoid of plot, making the reader ready to put it down after only a few chapters. It was also rather confusing at some points and the reader is led to believe many occurrences of improbable events that are explained as intentional because of the &#8220;improbability drive&#8221; in the main characters&#8217; space ship.The Hitchhiker&#8217;s Guide to the Galaxy severely lacks plot. The story focuses on the travels of four unlikely comrades and their morose robot, Marvin. The entire plot of the story can be summarized in a few sentences: The two characters from Earth get a ride on a spaceship, seconds before the Earth is destroyed, only to be kicked off of the ship into open space. Conveniently, they are picked up by a stolen ship powered by an &#8220;improbability drive&#8221;, hence the convenience of the Earthlings&#8217; pickup.... The book is pointless and has really no theme, symbolism, or any of the elements of literature that are to be expected in a novel.There is also surprisingly frequent use of common grammatical errors such as missing commas, misplaced modifiers, and sentence fragments. The grammar in the book makes it hard to respect the author much for his writing ability. There also seems to be large words used where they are unnecessary that just seem to be attempts to make the book seem better and the author smarter.One thing I liked about the book was the author&#8217;s use of the character Marvin, the eternally depressed robot programmed only to make lives miserable. Although Marvin was rather annoying, he accurately represents and criticizes people who act very much like him. Marvin was so depressing in fact that he saved the heroes lives by talking to another machine, making it feel compelled to kill itself. Obviously, Marvin is an exaggeration of people who only see the bad side of things, but he still brought forth thoughts of how people could be like that.Overall, The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy was a rather poor piece of literature that seemed to be more of a waste of time than an enjoyable novel. Douglas Adams shadows some aspects of the real world, but the poor writing, lack of plot, and undeveloped characters made the book less interesting and made it harder to notice a theme or relation to my life.",9,29
Jesus Land: A Memoir (Alex Awards (Awards)),"""A page turner...heart–stopping and enraging...focused, justified, and without a trace of self–pity. Shot through with poignancy."" —New York Times Book Review Over a decade after its first publication, Jesus Land remains deeply resonant with readers. Now with a new preface by the author, this New York Times bestselling memoir is a gripping tale of rage and redemption, hope and humor, morality and malice—and most of all, the truth: that being a good person takes more than just going to church. Julia and her adopted brother, David, are sixteen years old. Julia is white. David is black. It is the mid–1980s and their family has just moved to rural Indiana, a landscape of cottonwood trees, trailer parks, and an all–encompassing racism. At home are a distant mother—more involved with her church's missionaries than her own children—and a violent father. In this riveting and heartrending memoir Julia Scheeres takes us from the Midwest to a place beyond imagining. Surrounded by natural beauty, Escuela Caribe—a religious reform school in the Dominican Republic—is characterized by a disciplinary regime that extracts repentance from its students by any means necessary. Julia and David strive to make it through these ordeals and their tale is relayed here with startling immediacy, extreme candor, and wry humor.",['Julia Scheeres'],Catapult,2012,['Biography & Autobiography'],2.0,5.0,2005-11-04,Scary....,"It amazes me how our parents are supposed to be our protectors yet they can be the ones who hurt us the most. Julia Scheeres shows in this amazing story how her parents chose their beliefs in Jesus Christ over her well being. While they thought she had to save (sell out) her soul to Jesus, she was trying to be a normal teenager. She was sent away to a reform school in the middle of the Dominican Republic, which I am surprised to learn is still there. Those places in my opinion should be illegal, ans they are a form of child abuse. They brain wash these children into thinking they are serious sinners, when the worst thing Julia did was have sex with her boyfriend. Her poor brother did NOTHING. He was sent there so they did not have to deal with the black child any longer.The parents adopting the black children to find a spot in heavan - god help them. All those children were used for was for the public. Do these people really think God doesn't see what they do and did to these children behind the doors of their home? Once the parents sent David, the youngest black child to the reform school (the oldest one had ended up in juvinelle detention) she disenfected the basement they were living in, and complained how they lived like apes. This is the woman who brought them into her home and made them call her mother. She never let them back into her house again.I applaud Julia for writing about her experience. It could not have been an easy book to write. The fact that America is slowly turning into an evangilcal society makes this book all the more scary.....",13,14

The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich,"National Book Award Winner: The definitive account of Nazi Germany and “one of the most important works of history of our time” (The New York Times). When the Third Reich fell, it fell swiftly. The Nazis had little time to destroy their memos, their letters, or their diaries. William L. Shirer’s sweeping account of the Third Reich uses these unique sources, combined with his experience living in Germany as an international correspondent throughout the war. The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich earned Shirer a National Book Award and continues to be recognized as one of the most important and authoritative books about the Third Reich and Nazi Germany ever written. The diaries of propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels, as well as evidence and other testimony gained at the Nuremberg Trials, could not have found more artful hands. Shirer gives a clear, detailed, and well-documented account of how it was that Adolf Hitler almost succeeded in conquering the world. With millions of copies in print, The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich is a chilling and illuminating portrait of mankind’s darkest hours. “A monumental work.” —Theodore H. White",['William L.

Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed,"Now updated with new material that brings the killer's picture into clearer focus. In the fall of 1888, all of London was held in the grip of unspeakable terror. An elusive madman calling himself Jack the Ripper was brutally butchering women in the slums of London’s East End. Police seemed powerless to stop the killer, who delighted in taunting them and whose crimes were clearly escalating in violence from victim to victim. And then the Ripper’s violent spree seemingly ended as abruptly as it had begun. He had struck out of nowhere and then vanished from the scene. Decades passed, then fifty years, then a hundred, and the Ripper’s bloody sexual crimes became anemic and impotent fodder for puzzles, mystery weekends, crime conventions, and so-called “Ripper Walks” that end with pints of ale in the pubs of Whitechapel. But to number-one New York Times bestselling novelist Patricia Cornwell, the Ripper murders are not cute little mysteries to be transformed into parlor games or movies but rather a series of terrible crimes that no one should get away with, even after death. Now Cornwell applies her trademark skills for meticulous research and scientific expertise to dig deeper into the Ripper case than any detective before her—and reveal the true identity of this fabled Victorian killer. In Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper, Case Closed, Cornwell combines the rigorous discipline of twenty-first century police investigation with forensic techniques undreamed of during the late Victorian era to solve one of the most infamous and difficult serial murder cases in history. Drawing on unparalleled access to original Ripper evidence, documents, and records, as well as archival, academic, and law-enforcement resources, FBI profilers, and top forensic scientists, Cornwell reveals that Jack the Ripper was none other than a respected painter of his day, an artist now collected by some of the world’s finest museums: Walter Richard Sickert. It has been said of Cornwell that no one depicts the human capability for evil better than she. Adding layer after layer of circumstantial evidence to the physical evidence discovered by modern forensic science and expert minds, Cornwell shows that Sickert, who died peacefully in his bed in 1942, at the age of 81, was not only one of Great Britain’s greatest painters but also a serial killer, a damaged diabolical man driven by megalomania and hate. She exposes Sickert as the author of the infamous Ripper letters that were written to the Metropolitan Police and the press. Her detailed analysis of his paintings shows that his art continually depicted his horrific mutilation of his victims, and her examination of this man’s birth defects, the consequent genital surgical interventions, and their effects on his upbringing present a casebook example of how a psychopathic killer is created. New information and startling revelations detailed in Portrait of a Killer include: - How a year-long battery of more than 100 DNA tests—on samples drawn by Cornwell’s forensics team in September 2001 from original Ripper letters and Sickert documents—yielded the first shadows of the 75- to 114 year-old genetic evid...",['Patricia Cornwell'],Penguin,2002,['True Crime'],3.0,2.0,2002-12-23,Starts at the end and works backwards,"I was very anxious to read this book, but the hype outdid the reality. I have loved all of Cornwell's fiction and believed this would be in the same style, even though it is non-fiction. Wrong! I have 2 major complaints about this book.First, as other reviewers have said, she seems to have made her decision as to who the Ripper was and then pulls together evidence that supports her claim. She talks repeatedly about how little evidence there was and how hard it was to find much of it. Since it was so hard to find what she does have, how much evidence did she not find - evidence that could clear Stickart's name? When writing fiction, the author needs to first determine the solution and work backwards, building evidence for that ending. Real life doesn't work that way.Second, the writing does not flow well. She bounces from subject to subject with little or no break. Many times I found myself flipping back through the pages, trying to find when she changed thoughts and to what.All in all, this is an interesting study into the Jack the Ripper case. However, I feel Cornwell has gone too far in saying she has, hands down, solved the mystery",6,9

"Cybernetics, Second Edition: or the Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine","A classic and influential work that laid the theoretical foundations for information theory and a timely text for contemporary informations theorists and practitioners. With the influential book Cybernetics, first published in 1948, Norbert Wiener laid the theoretical foundations for the multidisciplinary field of cybernetics, the study of controlling the flow of information in systems with feedback loops, be they biological, mechanical, cognitive, or social. At the core of Wiener's theory is the message (information), sent and responded to (feedback); the functionality of a machine, organism, or society depends on the quality of messages. Information corrupted by noise prevents homeostasis, or equilibrium. And yet Cybernetics is as philosophical as it is technical, with the first chapter devoted to Newtonian and Bergsonian time and the philosophical mixed with the technical throughout. This book brings the 1961 second edition back into print, with new forewords by Doug Hill and Sanjoy Mitter. Contemporary readers of Cybernetics will marvel at Wiener's prescience—his warnings against “noise,” his disdain for “hucksters” and “gadget worshipers,” and his view of the mass media as the single greatest anti-homeostatic force in society. This edition of Cybernetics gives a new generation access to a classic text.",['Norbert Wiener'],MIT Press,2019,['Computers'],4.0,3.0,2012-08-06,Information and complexity,"I was looking for clues to support my hypothesis of information being the key element to understand complexity. Wiener was on the right track when he proposed a similar idea but unfortunately, for my case, I found too much of an outmoded mechanistic approach in his book (self-regulation instead of self-organization, for example) Nevertheless, if you have read the complexity and chaos authors and want to go back to some of the historical process that contributed, its a must read. I also find his integrating effort very valuable.",0,0

It is about the failure and shortcoming of any totalitarian system imposed upon human beings. A totalitarian system can be imposed by ruthless, selfish rulers regardless of the economic system. To be sure, Animal Farm is about the failures and shortcomings of the USSR, an experiment in state capitalism, monopolistic socialism or whatever you wish to call it. The point is it led to suffering at the hands of its elite, suffering that is unnecessary, brutal and senseless.Orwell's somber humor (""black humor"") is always refreshing. His books remind us that after all, we are all human beings and as such deserve respect.

The Poisonwood Bible,"'Breathtaking.' Sunday Times 'Exquisite.' The Times 'Beautiful.' Independent 'Powerful.' New York Times An international bestseller and a modern classic, this suspenseful epic of one family's tragic undoing and their remarkable reconstruction has been read, adored and shared by millions around the world. This story is told by the wife and four daughters of Nathan Price, a fierce, evangelical Baptist who takes his family and mission to the Belgian Congo in 1959. They carry with them everything they believe they will need from home, but soon find that all of it - from garden seeds to Scripture - is calamitously transformed on African soil. What readers are saying 'This remains one of the most fascinating books I have ever read.' 'I felt every emotion under the sky with this book.' 'Riveting.' 'This novel left a lasting - YEARS LASTING - impression.' 'This is one of those booksthat stands the test of time and is worth rereading.' 'Five epic, no-wonder-this-book-is-so-well-loved stars!'",['Barbara Kingsolver'],Faber & Faber,2008,['Fiction'],280.0,5.0,2000-03-17,A stunning and powerful story.,"I didn't want to read this book. And even after I began reading it, it did not pull me in for several chapters. But after the first time around, through each of the voices, the characters came clearly into focus, and I was lost. Even now, days after finishing the book, I remain in the spell it cast.Kingsolver presents this experience of an uprooted middle-American family desperately trying to adapt to life in the Congo from 5 different points of view - a mother, and each of her 4 very different daughters. Similarly to Pears' technique in An Instance of the Fingerpost, Kingsolver tells a part of the story from each different viewpoint. Like Pears, each of her narrators has a strong, clear, very real personality. But Kingsolver outdoes Pears in that each of her narrators has a characteristic voice all her own. Orleanna is a desperate and naive young mother, striving to keep her children well. Rachel is the self-centered beauty queen, Leah is an earnest, brilliant tomboy, Adah is Leah's crippled, bitter, perhaps more brilliant twin, and then there is little Ruth May, bossy and competitive. Each one's different perspective meshes with the others' to create a complete and engrossing picture of the whole.In the unfolding of the drama, there is a wealth of sensory detail, and plenty of humor to offset plenty of tragedy. The incongruous differences in social outlook, and the endless language difficulties make for lots of laughs, as well as some of the biggest tragedies.Someone should slap Alix Wilber for calling Kingsolver's presentation of her philosophical and political viewpoint a &quot;weakness&quot;. The message in this book is actually a social one, and isn't that one of the responsibilities of art? And whose viewpoint should she write from, if not her own? But the political message is anything but strident; the message and the story are entirely intertwined, each enhancing the other.",29,33
Exploring Worship: A Practical Guide to Praise & Worship,"Used as a text internationally, Exploring Worship lays a scriptural foundation for understanding what praise and worship really is, and then provides a practical framework for implementing praise and worship at the local church level.

The ""Revised/Updated version"" makes Exploring Worship once again a relevant equipping tool to today's worshipers.

The Basque History of the World,"""They are a mythical people, almost an imagined people,"" writes Mark Kurlansky. Settled in a corner of France and Spain in a land marked on no maps except their own, the Basques are a nation without a country, whose ancient and dramatic story illuminates Europe's own saga. Where did they come from? Signs of their civilization exist well before the arrival of the Romans in 218 B.C., and their culture appears to predate all others in Europe. Their mysterious and forbidden tongue, Euskera, is related to no other language on Earth. The Basques have stubbornly defended their unique culture against the Celts, the Romans, the Visigoths and Moors, the kings of Spain and France, Napoleon, Franco, the modern Spanish state, and the European Union. Yet as much as their origins are obscure, the Basques' contributions to world history have been clear and remarkable. Early explorers, they made fortunes whaling before the year 1000 and became the premier cod fishermen in Europe after discovering Canada's Grand Banks. Juan Sebastian de Elcano, a Basque, was the first man to circumnavigate the globe in 1522. Their influence has also been felt in religion as founders of the Jesuits in 1534, and in business, as leaders of the Industrial Revolution in southern Europe. Mark Kurlanky's passion for the Basque people, and his exuberant eye for detail, shine throughout this fascinating history. Like his acclaimed Cod, it blends human, economic, political, literary and culinary history into a rich and heroic tale.",['Mark Kurlansky'],Knopf Canada,2011,['History'],31.0,5.0,2005-08-03,If you are of Basque ancestry...,"If as many latinamericans you have have a Basque surname and don't know what to make of it, you owe it to yourself to read this book: You will be amazed at the disproportionate contribution that the Basque people has made to history, that may very well be a piece of your family's history, if only in a distant and romantic way. Feel free to brag! As a bonus, if you actually do have Basque blood in your veins, you may even recognize some of your character traits that could be difficult to explain otherwise!

On the Road,"NATIONAL BESTSELLER • WINNER OF THE PULITZER PRIZE • A searing, post-apocalyptic novel about a father and son's fight to survive, this ""tale of survival and the miracle of goodness only adds to McCarthy's stature as a living master. It's gripping, frightening and, ultimately, beautiful"" (San Francisco Chronicle). A father and his son walk alone through burned America. Nothing moves in the ravaged landscape save the ash on the wind. It is cold enough to crack stones, and when the snow falls it is gray. The sky is dark. Their destination is the coast, although they don't know what, if anything, awaits them there. They have nothing; just a pistol to defend themselves against the lawless bands that stalk the road, the clothes they are wearing, a cart of scavenged food—and each other. The Road is the profoundly moving story of a journey. It boldly imagines a future in which no hope remains, but in which the father and his son, ""each the other's world entire,"" are sustained by love. Awesome in the totality of its vision, it is an unflinching meditation on the worst and the best that we are capable of: ultimate destructiveness, desperate tenacity, and the tenderness that keeps two people alive in the face of total devastation.",['Cormac McCarthy'],Vintage,2007,['Fiction'],1024.0,2.0,2006-06-19,Nahhh ...,"Tried to like it.

Is there life on other worlds?,"Does life exist on other planets? This 1998 book presents the scientific basis for thinking there may be life elsewhere in the Universe. It is the first to cover the entire breadth of recent exciting discoveries, including the discovery of planets around other stars and the possibility of fossil life in meteorites from Mars. Suitable for the general reader, this authoritative book avoids technical jargon and is well illustrated throughout. It covers all the major topics, including the origin and early history of life on Earth, the environmental conditions necessary for life to exist, the possibility that life might exist elsewhere in our Solar System, the occurrence of planets around other stars and their habitability, and the possibility of intelligent extraterrestrial life. For all those interested in understanding the scientific evidence for and likelihood of extraterrestrial life, this is the most comprehensive and readable book to date.",['Bruce Jakosky'],Cambridge University Press,1998,['Science'],2.0,5.0,2006-10-04,Scientific speculation at its best,"This is richly detailed consideration of questions concerning life on other worlds. It considers exploration and colonization of Space, communication with extraterrestial intelligences, the kinds of minds extraterrestials are likely to have, the character of human colonies and their likely transformations in time, the means by which we might enhance life on earth through connection with extraterrestials. Anderson one of the foremost Science Fiction Writers of the Isaac Asimov generation is scientifically literate, and boldly imaginative.The major difficulty with the work is that so much of it is speculative, even in regard to answering the question of the book's title , as to whether there is life on other worlds. Anderson is among those who strongly believe that there is almost certainly such life.In speaking about forms of such life more ancient than us he has this to say.""So my guess is that the older races in the universe may have somewhat greater ability to visualize, imagine , and reason than we have, but if so, it is not overwhelmingly greater. Our highest intellects could talk to them, and understand most of what they are doing, though we might never have thought of it for ourselves. However , by human standards, our elders are apt to be emotional giants, with a balance, an insight, a creativity, such as we can hardly imagine- but which we could learn some sanity ourselves.""Here the optimistic Anderson obviously has his eye on the dangerous Cold War balance- of - mutually - assured destruction . And he is clearly one of those who does not believe Mankind's having developed weapons of mass- destruction guarantees our using them. Instead he suggests that Mankind will eventually make its way out to other worlds whose connection with their home will be nonetheless eventually lost.Pascal wrote that the ' silence of these infinite spaces casts me into dread'. When I myself contemplate worlds of the kind Anderson proposes I do not feel assured, but rather a strange anxiety that the great distances mean we will only always be strangers to any other kind of 'mind' there is. And this with the one exception and the religious question Anderson does not raise, whether there might be before and after One and Only One Mind Who made and sustains and will somehow 'save' us all.",3,3
Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell Signed,"In the Hugo-award winning, epic New York Times Bestseller and basis for the BBC miniseries, two men change England's history when they bring magic back into the world. In the midst of the Napoleonic Wars in 1806, most people believe magic to have long since disappeared from England - until the reclusive Mr. Norrell reveals his powers and becomes an overnight celebrity. Another practicing magician then emerges: the young and daring Jonathan Strange. He becomes Norrell's pupil, and the two join forces in the war against France. But Strange is increasingly drawn to the wild, most perilous forms of magic, and he soon risks sacrificing his partnership with Norrell and everything else he holds dear.

This book was in severe need of some editing. On these pages, I've seem some readers compare it to Jane Austen. Don't compare this style to that of Jane Austen. Jane Austen is witty, and her characters have depth and life. The characters in Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell are mostly flat.With that said, there are some subplots that intrigue me; however, it takes so long to resume those stories that I get bored until she picks up the interesting twists again.

Howl's Moving Castle,"This entrancing classic fantasy novel is filled with surprises at every turn. An international bestseller, this much-loved book is the source for the Academy Award nominee for Best Animated Feature. Sophie has the great misfortune of being the eldest of three daughters, destined to fail miserably should she ever leave home to seek her fate. But when she unwittingly attracts the ire of the Witch of the Waste, Sophie finds herself under a horrid spell that transforms her into an old lady. Her only chance at breaking it lies in the ever-moving castle in the hills: the Wizard Howl's castle. To untangle the enchantment, Sophie must handle the heartless Howl, strike a bargain with a fire demon, and meet the Witch of the Waste head-on. Along the way, she discovers that there's far more to Howl—and herself—than first meets the eye. In this giant jigsaw puzzle of a fantasy, people and things are never quite what they seem. Destinies are intertwined, identities exchanged, lovers confused. The Witch has placed a spell on Howl. Does the clue to breaking it lie in a famous poem? And what will happen to Sophie Hatter when she enters Howl's castle?

An American Tragedy,"The author's classic vision of the dark side of American life looks at the failings of the American dream, in the story of the rise and fall of Clyde Griffiths, who sacrifices everything in his desperate quest for success.","['Theodore Dreiser', 'Richard Lingeman', 'Margaret E. Mitchell']",Signet Classic,2010,['Fiction'],17.0,5.0,2012-11-30,"Great, Dense, Realistic Story","I came into reading An American Tragedy by Theodore Dreiser in an unusual way. I was writing a fictional murder mystery which involved a 1960s drowning in Lake Singletary in Sutton, Massachusetts. When talking with friends about my plot, they pointed out that there HAD been a drowning in Lake Singletary, in 1935. Newall P. Sherman, a married man, had fallen for a young mill-factory co-worker. So he took his wife Alice out into the lake in a rowboat and drowned her. The trial became a nation-wide sensation and was called ""An American Tragedy"" by many of the papers. The writers were referencing this book which had come out exactly ten years before. There is little doubt that Sherman's actions were based on this book.What makes the tale even more fascinating is that An American Tragedy, while fiction, is based on a real life drowning in 1906. Chester Gillette was the man in question and Grace Brown was the woman he drowned. So we have art imitating real life, and then real life imitating art. And then came the movie A Place in the Sun, and on it goes.So reading the book was fascinating to me, because at that point I'd learned all about the 1935 real life drowning caused by the book. The book lays out in substantial detail how the process unfolded, even going back to the protagonist, Clyde Griffith's, youngest days. This 866 page book goes into rich exploration of just how this man grew up, hit hurdles, overcame them, and got to the point that he was in a factory with a young woman. We understand by then all the complex aspects of his character and his concerns and fears and desires.We get the same with Roberta. We learn why she held out against and then finally gave in to Clyde's advances. We understand her fears and concerns when she gets pregnant. We have a sense of the confusion and unhappiness and tension as they try to figure out what to do.Lest we get sidetracked by a debate of contraception rights, the point wasn't that it was a pregnancy specifically that caused the issue. It could have been anything equally life-changing. The focus of the book is on how Clyde and Roberta reacted mentally and emotionally to that challenge. Nearly all of us hit hurdles in life that are life changing hurdles of some sort. We are presented with a range of options on how to get past them. A key focus of this book is on how we, as flawed humans, look at those options and try to sort and choose from them.Yes we all have a sense of ""right"" and ""wrong"" - and it's clear in looking at humanity that each of us has a slightly different yardstick from our neighbors. It's not even just a ""help me or help others"" single-sided slider. There are all sorts of different dimensions. Do we hold family / friends to different standards? Do we help strangers? Are we frugal? Do we worry about our reputation? There are so many different things that we take into account, that it's no wonder that, like snowflakes, no two of us are exactly alike.So these are the things Dreiser examines. Each person in the story has his or her own flaws and positive traits and foibles. Lawyers are swayed by politics. Witnesses are swayed by their reputation. Mothers are swayed by family ties. We all twist and bend based on the specific things we value.Certainly we might hope that, should we find ourselves in a dire strait, we would not take a route out which seriously hurt another person. Still, life rarely has a perfect balance. For example, we know that every day 25,000 people die of hunger. That includes 16,000 children. So in this one day today, 25,000 people have died due to having no food. The WFO states they only need 50 cents to feed a person for a day. So let's say I ""splurge"" on a $5 coffee-and-muffin every day. That is 10 people I could have kept alive - and instead I ""selfishly"" spent it on a whim for myself instead.We argue that we deserve luxuries that we worked for, and maybe that's true. But maybe it's also true that a human being's life should be worth more than a luxury item. If that person was right in front of us, and we knew our 50 cents would ensure they survived the day, would we give it to them? If so, why does it matter if they're in the next town over?Again my point is that each of us makes those decisions through our own complex lens. I know people with laptop computers and smart phones who feel they are poor. I know people with no electronic items at all, no electricity, and an outhouse in their back yard who still share portions of their food and supplies with the less fortunate. We all make these decisions every day, and the book does a great job of delving into how complex they can be.",1,2
House of Mirth,"A black comedy of manners about vast wealth and a woman who can define herself only through the perceptions of others. The beautiful Lily Bart lives among the nouveaux riches of New York City – people whose millions were made in railroads, shipping, land speculation and banking. In this morally and aesthetically bankrupt world, Lily, age twenty-nine, seeks a husband who can satisfy her cravings for endless admiration and all the trappings of wealth. But her quest comes to a scandalous end when she is accused of being the mistress of a wealthy man. Exiled from her familiar world of artificial conventions, Lily finds life impossible.

It is also the story of the downfall of one woman, who attempts to live by her own rules, with no sponsor and no money of her own. Her parents are dead and she lives with relatives.Lily Bart is one of society's most eligible women, at the height of her powers, when the novel opens. Though she has little money, she has family connections, good breeding and the hope of coming into an inheritance. Beautiful and very charming, Lily has been brought up to be an ornament, as were most women of her class at that time. She is a gilded bird with a noble heart, but clearly she is not aware of the restrictions of her cage. Part of Lily's tragedy is that she does have character, spirit, and a conscience. However, she does not know how to align these attributes, with her ornamental avocation, and her ambitions to marry a wealthy man of good birth.As expected, Lily is popular with both bachelors and married men. Most of the bachelors propose marriage at on time or another. The only man she has real affection for is her dear friend, Lawrence Seldon, a barrister, whose lack of income makes him entirely unsuitable as a husband. Lily had developed a gambling habit to support her lifestyle, and supplement her allowance. An unfortunate losing streak has put her into debt. In her naivete, she forms an unsavory business alliance with a married man. Later, she is unjustly accused of having an affair with him and their business arrangement also come to light.Her family cuts her off without a penny. Society friends and connections reject their former darling, trying to extricate themselves from any repercussions Lily's indiscreet behavior may have on their reputations. Former friends turn vicious. The irony is that Lily has never committed any of the sins she is accused of. Several of her friends have, and frequently...but their sins are committed with the utmost discretion. Lily's crime is indiscretion. Her beaus disappear, as do her marriage prospects. The hypocrisy of her class becomes more apparent to her, as she searches for a means to survive, with all the familiar doors closed in her face.Lily seeks employment as a seamstress in the New York City slums, and lives there also, in a humble room with no refinements. Having no formal training and no real ambition, (her ambivalence about work is obvious), she sinks into deep depression and begins to decline. Laudanum helps her to sleep, and she becomes dependent on the drug.Lily's descent, from society's beautiful darling to a disheveled, desperate woman living in a shabby hotel room, addicted to drugs, is disturbing reading, to say the least. Her decline seems inevitable, especially after we read of her many poor and self-destructive decisions. She seems to sabotage herself. However, Lily Bart is ultimately the victim of a cruel society that sacrifices anyone who does not conform to its expectations.After reading ""House Of Mirth,"" for the first time several years ago, Lily's character has remained clear in my mind. I think of her from time to time with great poignance and a sense of personal loss.",111,119

I know this much is true,"With his stunning debut novel, She's Come Undone, Wally Lamb won the adulation of critics and readers with his mesmerizing tale of one woman's painful yet triumphant journey of self-discovery. Now, this brilliantly talented writer returns with I Know This Much Is True, a heartbreaking and poignant multigenerational saga of the reproductive bonds of destruction and the powerful force of forgiveness. A masterpiece that breathtakingly tells a story of alienation and connection, power and abuse, devastation and renewal--this novel is a contemporary retelling of an ancient Hindu myth. A proud king must confront his demons to achieve salvation. Change yourself, the myth instructs, and you will inhabit a renovated world. When you're the same brother of a schizophrenic identical twin, the tricky thing about saving yourself is the blood it leaves on your bands--the little inconvenience of the look-alike corpse at your feet. And if you're into both survival of the fittest and being your brother's keeper--if you've promised your dying mother--then say so long to sleep and hello to the middle of the night. Grab a book or a beer. Get used to Letterman's gap-toothed smile of the absurd, or the view of the bedroom ceiling, or the influence of random selection. Take it from a godless insomniac. Take it from the uncrazy twin--the guy who beat the biochemical rap. Dominick Birdsey's entire life has been compromised and constricted by anger and fear, by the paranoid schizophrenic twin brother he both deeply loves and resents, and by the past they shared with their adoptive father, Ray, a spit-and-polish ex-Navy man (the five-foot-six-inch sleeping giant who snoozed upstairs weekdays in the spare room and built submarines at night), and their long-suffering mother, Concettina, a timid woman with a harelip that made her shy and self-conscious: She holds a loose fist to her face to cover her defective mouth--her perpetual apology to the world for a birth defect over which she'd had no control. Born in the waning moments of 1949 and the opening minutes of 1950, the twins are physical mirror images who grow into separate yet connected entities: the seemingly strong and protective yet fearful Dominick, his mother's watchful ""monkey""; and the seemingly weak and sweet yet noble Thomas, his mother's gentle ""bunny."" From childhood, Dominick fights for both separation and wholeness--and ultimately self-protection--in a house of fear dominated by Ray, a bully who abuses his power over these stepsons whose biological father is a mystery. I was still afraid of his anger but saw how he punished weakness--pounced on it. Out of self-preservation I hid my fear, Dominick confesses. As for Thomas, he just never knew how to play defense. He just didn't get it. But Dominick's talent for survival comes at an enormous cost, including the breakup of his marriage to the warm, beautiful Dessa, whom he still loves. And it will be put to the ultimate test when Thomas, a Bible-spouting zealot, commits an unthinkable act that threatens the tenuous balance of both his and Dominick's lives. To save himself, Dominick must confront not only the pain of his past but the dark secrets he has locked deep within himself, and the sins of his ancestors--a quest that will lead him beyond the confines of his blue-collar New England town to the volcanic foothills of Sicily 's Mount Etna, where his ambitious and vengefully proud grandfather and a namesake Domenico Tempesta, the sostegno del famiglia, was born. Each of the stories Ma told us about Papa reinforced the message that he was the boss, that he ruled the roost, that what he said went. Searching for answers, Dominick turns to the whispers of the dead, to the pages of his grandfather's handwritten memoir, The History of Domenico Onofrio Tempesta, a Great Man from Humble Beginnings. Rendered with touches of magic realism, Domenico's fablelike tale--in which monkeys enchant and religious statues weep--becomes the old man's confession--an unwitting legacy of contrition that reveals the truth's of Domenico's life, Dominick learns that power, wrongly used, defeats the oppressor as well as the oppressed, and now, picking through the humble shards of his deconstructed life, he will search for the courage and love to forgive, to expiate his and his ancestors' transgressions, and finally to rebuild himself beyond the haunted shadow of his twin. Set against the vivid panoply of twentieth-century America and filled with richly drawn, memorable characters, this deeply moving and thoroughly satisfying novel brings to light humanity's deepest needs and fears, our aloneness, our desire for love and acceptance, our struggle to survive at all costs.

The locals, including some who had been friendly with Ed, decide to take matters into their own hands.This book is an interesting character study of not only Watson, but of those who turned against him, with little or no evidence, and why.

Although the subject matter is very disturbing in many ways, it also is interesting to review the path to power of the Nazis and their eventual defeat. Reading Shirer's book you feel as if you are looking over Hitler's shoulder as he and his court make decisions that seal the fate of their enemies and their nation. An important lesson for Americans is the fact that the Nazis were able to manipulate the democratic process to their advantage and upon gaining power were then able to consolidate through favors to the military and industry. Although the ending of the story is well-known, the details of life in facist Germany, including narratives about daily life, education, and industry, illustrate the total control Hitler gained as his regime continued. It is chilling to think of what Europe and the world would be today if the Nazis had prevailed.

We are spiritual beings living a physical life. Your souls wisdom is FAR greater than simply intellectual data. It contains every experience you have ever had, from every life you have ever lived, whether you believe in reincarnation or not does not matter. What does matter is that you more are open to what your heart and soul came into this life to express, and that can only come from moving into your heart, where all truth resides, and bringing that wisdom forth in your life by BEING your highest self.

In the fresh and vivid prose that is his trademark, he not only reveals the celebrated history of bullfighters and warrior kings, painters and processions, cathedrals and olive orchards, he also shares the intimate, often hidden country he came to know, where the congeniality of living souls is thrust against the dark weight of history.

Smith'],Simon and Schuster,2016,['Juvenile Fiction'],6.0,5.0,2000-10-23,An Amazing Book,"As a Pagan Witch, I found this book both entertaining and fascinating. It is a work of fiction and that shows strongly in the plot with devices such as the bad witch vs. good witch theme and a total disregard for human life. I include this as a warning to other Pagans who may be offended by these themes.Despite the facts above, L.J. Smith actually did her research! If you are Wiccan, you will get a kick out this book if you can ignore the innacuracies of the plot line. You'll find the Rede, mentions of herbs and their associations, a fairly accurate portrayal of the Burning Times and a few mentions of circle casting and spellwork. You'll also find a running theme of Maiden/Mother/Crone. For those Pagans or Witches who are not Wiccan (like me), you might enjoy the overall message/s of the book as well as the fairly accurate Pagan elements.Of course, the first thing that impressed me were the strong female Witch characters. The second was the actual accuracies in the book. Oh yes, and there were male Witches. Pagan fiction isn't exactly readily available, so I'll take what I can get in that department. The plotline is VERY innacurate (includes vampires, a &quot;world&quot; of Witches and a hatred of humans), so be prepared for this.Onto the entertainment value of the book. I devour books. I picked this one up for a quick &quot;fluffy&quot; read. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was really quite good. Her writing will take you into another world and if you love reading, you will likely devour this book in one sitting. The writing is fantastic. Most of the characters are well written and the book flows very well. Very entertaining and satisfying.I have to rate this book with 5 stars as a result of incredible energy rush I received after reading it.Off to ground myself, Enchantress B. RM.",4,5

What else do you need?,"I, like many others who are drawn to this particular genre of books tend to hold them to the standard of Patrick O'Brian. In this case I believe Mr. Griffin acquits himself quite well. I have read other &quot;first time writers&quot; who have received more praise and liked their books much less.This novel is much darker than any books by O'Brian but this should be expected given that the main character is the infamous pirate Black Bart. The premise of the book is one seen before in the likes of such books as Steven Pressfields' Gates of Fire: A previously unknown biographer had been present to record as history what had been thought hereto unrecorded. A great premise and on that worked very well in Gates of Fire, however Mr. Griffin misses the opportunity to use this idea fully by merely including the character of the biographer into the story line instead of utilizing him as eyewitness to history. This would allow us the opportunity to immerse ourselves into believing we are discovering the undiscovered instead of reading a fictional account of history. Perhaps this would have also provided for a better opportunity for learning the motivations behind the actions of the people in the book. William Williams (our biographer) provides little if any insight. Most of the characters remain just out of reach of gaining our sympathies because they remain for the most part vague and poorly defined.Despite these drawbacks I thoroughly enjoyed reading this adventure. The shipboard life is well represented and believable. The story is paced well and kept my attention. I would deem it worthy of the price and time spent to acquire it for yourself and your library.",2,2

Anderson']",Tor Science Fiction,2019,['Fiction'],16.0,1.0,2012-11-22,Perhaps the worst book ever written,"Jesus only hung on the cross for three days. I have read four hundred and fifty-four PAGES of Dune: The Butlerian Jihad.And I did it to save your soul....When I was ten years old I was quite precocious. I read and loved Asimov's Foundation trilogy, and had a voracious appetite for new books. So I picked up Frank Herbert's Dune without a second thought.I never saw it coming.A hundred pages later I was startled to feel tears pouring down my young face; tears of pure frustration. The book was hard, too hard and complex for my ten-year-old mind to cope with. In a fit of fury, I threw the book across the room.I hated Dune for years. Herbert, too. But my reading speed is way too fast, so by the time I was sixteen or so I couldn't avoid reading some other Herbert books. Not in the Dune series, of course - the memory of those tears still stung - but Whipping Star. It was also hard, quite complex, but not (I thought) as hard as Dune had been. It certainly made me think.And more and more I came to realize that it was a damned impressive book, one worth reading again and again. The concepts were difficult to grasp, but each re-reading brought something new, a fuller understanding; and it was a really good book. So I looked up the sequel (also good, although not quite as endearing). I looked up other short stories that Herbert had set in the same universe. Excellent, and all too rare. From there it was natural to move into Herbert's other short science fiction; the early stuff was a little bit clunky and formulaic, but the later stories were masterful and quite deep.And so of course I found myself moving, step by step, back to Dune.And it was good.Not perfect, but very very good indeed; it could easily even be called ""great"". Over the years my mind had developed enough to be able to take on Frank Herbert's vision and comprehend it. I went on to read all the books in the series, and while some of the later ones were uneven, I enjoyed them all.Cut to 2003. I am desperately poor, struggling to pay the mortgage and support my family (including our toddler) on a single income. This is a deadly situation. Where once I went to Avenue Victor Hugo and other great used bookstores at least two or three times a week and bought a dozen books at a time, now I haven't picked up even ONE new book - new or used - in months.Thank Shai-Halud for the public library! I hadn't been to the library in years, but I started taking Sebastian (my son) there on Saturday mornings. He loved it. While the Woonsocket library is comparatively small and poorly-stocked, it still has a number of books worth reading - and of course far more are available through inter-library loan.Since I spend two hours a day on the train, I need lots of reading material...so I've been taking out a lot of books. I'll write about most of them later, but right now there's one that is crying, screaming, howling for treatment.The Son Is Not The FatherOh dear god. I cannot express the horror. The sheer... stupidity that is Dune: The Butlerian Jihad. Frank Herbert wrote with incredible depth and complexity, giving hints of a world far deeper than the portion he showed in his books. It gave a feeling of magic, a sensation of thousands of years of unknown (and unknowable) history underlying every paragraph. At the same time he took elements of modern culture and extrapolated from them brilliantly.I will be kind to Brian Herbert, Frank's son. His hands should not be cut off. He simply commited the sin of cashing in on his famous father's talent, and prostituting his family name - which is unforgivable, since he isn't a writer. But he should never have been allowed to ""write"" a book, particularly not a Dune book.Good god, he sucks. The writing is dreadful; where his father's prose was complex, Brian's is not just simplistic, but downright childish - even moronic. Where Frank used hidden depths to intrigue and add luster, Brian has taken many of those elements and simply ruined them, directly tying them to modern Earth issues and repeating them over and over. Frank had the gift of names, occasionally tying them in with ancient Earth history; Brian names ALL of his characters after famous historical figures from Earth history, for NO &^%#ing REASON.Ah yes. Over and over. The degree of repetition in this hellish book is more extreme than anything I have ever seen in my life. EVERY point is hammered home with astonishingly dull and lifeless prose, and then repeated again every twenty pages or so. EVERY moral point (cretinous as they are) is made so clear that a vegetable couldn't help but get it, and then repeated again a few dozen times for good measure.Let me give you a taste of what I went through:PARODY:The mighty robot Evil Badd entered the room. As he did, his mekkano-taste-probe tasted the brain of the baby human child he was gnawing on. The blonde-haired, blue-eyed tot had died in Evil Badd's cruel mekkano-claw with scarcely a whimper. The lovely human slave Beauty Goode looked up listlessly at the entry of the mighty and evil robot.""Ah-ha, Beauty Goode, I see you have awoken from what you humans call ""unconsciousness"", said Evil Badd. ""I am Evil Badd, your new master. I am a robot. I like to eat babies. Some think that I am evil and bad. But I am a robot of pure logic.""""Yes, Master"", said Beauty Goode submissively. Secretly she thought ""I must find a way to resist the evil Evil Badd. He is evil, and that could be...bad!""""Mind if I rip your uterus out for no reason, and eat your baby?"" asked Evil Badd, ripping out Beauty Goode's uterus with his rapacious mekkano-claw.Sorry to inflict that on you. But what you have just read is ONE THOUSAND TIMES BETTER than the hundreds pages of fetid so-called writing that I had to wade through.Ah, but nothing could prepare me for the horror of3. 2. 4.Page 324, not a parody this time but the ACTUAL TEXT:[There has been a huge accident, and a number of slaves have been killed. The nobles look on at the carnage.]""In a wry voice, Bludd said, ""Not one of your most successful efforts, Tio.""""But you must admit, the concept shows promise, Lord Bludd. Look at the destructive potential,"" Holtzman said, looking at the unruffled nobles without even considering the dead and injured slaves. ""We can be thankful that no one was hurt.""Get it? There were lots of dead slaves, but the nobles were saying that no one was hurt! That's irony! Get it? Don't you GET IT, you moron?I'll give Brian Herbert this: he certainly knows his audience.Okay. Now, apart from the fact that any book with a character named ""Lord Bludd"" should automatically earn the death penalty for its authors, please note that the authors nonetheless feel it necessary to point out the TOTALLY OBVIOUS. ""without even considering the dead and injured slaves"" - gosh, thanks for pointing out that irony, because we readers are SO STUPID that we'd have missed it, yes sirree!I don't know if the authors assumed that the readers were total morons, or if they're just so incredibly stupid themselves that they didn't realize that hammering the irony breaks it.Enough. I've tortured myself enough with this astonishingly inept and painful book. Let it be noted that some moron named Kevin J. Anderson co-wrote it, and that since he is NOT related to Frank Herbert, there is no reason that his hands shouldn't be cut off. Supposedly he has written 29 national bestsellers. If that's the case, it only justifies my belief that virtually all modern genre fiction is utter garbage.Speaking of which, The New York Times, The Philadelphia Inquirer, The Oregonian, Kirkus Reviews, Booklist, and Publishers Weekly all apparently have had rave reviews of the new ""Dune"" books, according to excerpts printed on the back cover. Unless these have been taken wildly out of context or out-and-out fabricated, they merit the death penalty for every one of these publications and everyone associated with them. It need not be painful; I am not vengeful by nature. As long as they never kill a single tree or brain cell with their so-called ""writing"" ever again.That is all.",1,1
Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass,"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass First published in 1845, Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass is an eye-opening depiction of American slavery. Part autobiography, part human-rights treatise, it describes the everyday horrors inflicted on captive laborers, as well as the strength and courage needed to survive. Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass Born into slavery on a Maryland plantation in 1818, Frederick Douglass spent years secretly teaching himself to read and write—a crime for which he risked life and limb. After two failed escapes, Douglass finally, blessedly boarded a train in 1838 that would eventually lead him to New York City and freedom. Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass Few books have done more to change America’s notion of African Americans than this seminal work. Beyond its historical and social relevancy, it is admired today for its gripping stories, the intensity of spirit, and heartfelt humanity. Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass This ebook has been professionally proofread to ensure accuracy and readability on all devices. Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass Born into a life of bondage, Frederick Douglass secretly taught himself to read and write. It was a crime punishable by death, but it resulted in one of the most eloquent indictments of slavery ever recorded. His gripping narrative takes us into the fields, cabins, and manors of pre–Civil War plantations in the South and reveals the daily terrors he suffered. Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass Written more than a century and a half ago by a Black man who went on to become a famous orator, U.S. minister to Haiti, and leader of his people, this timeless classic still speaks directly to our age.

From compassion, addiction, and psychological and emotional healing, to dealing with problems involving relationships and sexuality, to the creation of a Zen-like simplicity and balance in all facets of life, it speaks to the concerns of many modern spiritual seekers, both those beginning on the path and those with years of experience. A Path with Heart is filled with practical techniques, guided meditations, stories, koans, and other gems of wisdom that can help ease your journey through the world. The author’s own profound—and sometimes humorous—experiences and gentle assistance will skillfully guide you through the obstacles and trials of spiritual and contemporary life to bring a clarity of perception and a sense of the sacred into your everyday experience. Reading this book will touch your heart and remind you of the promises inherent in meditation and in a life of the spirit: the blossoming of inner peace, wholeness, and understanding, and the achievement of a happiness that is not dependent on external conditions. Sure to be a classic, A Path with Heart shows us how we can bring our spirituality to flower every day of our lives. It is a wise and gentle guidebook for an odyssey into the soul that enables us to achieve a deeper, more satisfying life in the world.",['Jack Kornfield'],Bantam,2009,"['Body, Mind & Spirit']",7.0,4.0,2008-11-20,Velvet Glove,"Kornfield's book is so soft-touch that it's very easy to miss just how hardcore and no-nonsense a practice he describes and advocates, and just how pragmatic it is.",1,1

Dreams of Trespass: Tales of a Harem Girlhood,"This ""wonderful and enchanting"" memoir tells the revelatory true story of one Muslim girl's life in her family's French Moroccan harem, set against the backdrop of World War II (The New York Times Book Review). ""I was born in a harem in 1940 in Fez, Morocco..."" So begins Fatima Mernissi in this illuminating narrative of a childhood behind the iron gates of a domestic harem. In Dreams of Trespass, Mernissi weaves her own memories with the dreams and memories of the women who surrounded her in the courtyard of her youth -- women who, without access to the world outside, recreated it from sheer imagination. A beautifully written account of a girl confronting the mysteries of time and place, gender and sex, Dreams of Trespass illuminates what it was like to be a modern Muslim woman in a place steeped in tradition.",['Fatima Mernissi'],Basic Books,1995,['Religion'],6.0,5.0,2000-04-19,Life in a Harem Through a Child's Eyes,"Dreams of Trespass is an easy-reading book explaining life in a harem, through a young girl's eyes.

Dreams of Trespass explains life in a Harem, which allows the readers to breakdown common stereotypes. This is an excellent book that explains the Islamic culture in an easy to understand way.",4,4
Lord of the Flies,"William Golding’s unforgettable classic of boyhood adventure and the savagery of humanity comes to Penguin Classics in a stunning Graphic Deluxe Edition with a new foreword by Lois Lowry As provocative today as when it was first published in 1954, Lord of the Flies continues to ignite passionate debate with its startling, brutal portrait of human nature. William Golding’s compelling story about a group of very ordinary boys marooned on a coral island has been labeled a parable, an allegory, a myth, a morality tale, a parody, a political treatise, and even a vision of the apocalypse. But above all, it has earned its place as one of the indisputable classics of the twentieth century for readers of any age. This Penguin Classics Graphic Deluxe Edition features an array of special features to supplement the novel, including a foreword by Lois Lowry, an introduction by Stephen King, an essay by E. M. Forster, an essay on teaching and reading the novel and suggestions for further exploration by scholar Jennifer Buehler, and an extended note by E. L. Epstein, the publisher of the first American paperback edition of Lord of the Flies. For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date translations by award-winning translators.",['William Golding'],Penguin,2016,['Fiction'],2861.0,4.0,2003-05-08,Lord of the Flies,"If you are a William Golding fan, or you desire a novel jam-packed with action and excitement from cover to cover, you will love Golding's most famous novel, Lord of the Flies. In this literary masterpiece, Golding takes an imaginative look at the life of young boys in an extraordinary situation: without rules, boundaries, or a defined social system. His boundless sense of imagination, and his unparalleled creativity allow him to form a lifelike environment in which the reader can capture a sense of reality on such a seemingly bazaar topic. Set on a small deserted tropical island, thickly wooded by rain a forest, and a harsh jungle, the boys often have trouble in their fight for survival. One may ask... How did the boys find themselves on this island?During a nuclear war, at an unspecified time in future, a plane carrying British schoolboys crash-landed, the boys found themselves alone and helpless. Golding did not set a specific time period in which the story takes place. By doing this, he allows us, the reader, to put the story in the time we desire - making it more enjoyable to its variety of readers. The boys had crash-landed on their new home; and few other people would ever believe the story of this place should the boys ever return to Britain one day to tell it. The perseverance, and leadership of a few twelve year olds, kept the majority of the six to twelve year old bys occupied and leading productive lives away from the civilization they were accustom to. William Golding tells the story of the boy's interminable stay on this otherwise - despondent piece of rock. Golding stresses their trials and tribulations on this undiscovered place, and how boys become savages when culture and pressure are not present in someone's life. The boys' primitive instincts reared their ugly heads while they were living on the island - they had never lived in such a way ever before. .The novel begins with two boys, Ralph and ""Piggy"", who at first are alone - no other boys are present. They are looking at the destruction of the jungle caused by the rough descent of their plane. Eventually the boys begin to congregate. Showing a great sense of maturity, Ralph takes charge - and assesses their situation. The boys range from six to twelve years old, and at first it seems like there is no way to keep order. Ralph decides that they are going to run their island as a democracy - the boys vote to keep Ralph as their leader, though many of the boys stay loyal to Jack. A few of the biguns (or older boys) were fighting for control of the island. Jack, another boy of twelve, rivals Ralph for leadership throughout the novel - Jack quickly becomes the leader of the hunters. Previously, a group of choirboys, the hunters became a savage faction. They collected pigs and other forms of meat for the boys to eat in addition to their regular diets of berries.Ralph, despite Jacks competition, was able to maintain control of most of the boys for the better part of the story. His own minor digressions into savagery however, put his leadership into question - and Jack eventually took control of the island. Golding's last fifty pages, depict an island in utter chaos. His satiristic attitude of the adult world, mock the political and militaristic disputes in our world now. He shows how a small group of boys can sum up our entire society with both political rivalries, and groups battling each other for control. Lord of the Flies is a great novel! William Golding really struck gold on this one! Take a journey unlike any other - a planeload of preteens, lost on an uninhabited island. A fight of their own accompanies their fight for survival on this small-unknown isle. Will they ever get off?",0,1
IN THE LAKE OF THE WOODS,"This riveting novel of love and mystery from the author of The Things They Carried examines the lasting impact of the twentieth century’s legacy of violence and warfare, both at home and abroad.

"The Threat Within (Star Wars: Jedi Apprentice, Book 18)","Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon face off against each other in the most intense, most thrilling JEDI APPRENTICE yet. In a land where the old rule, the young rebel. Obi-Wan Kenobi, now 16, is ready to take a big step to becoming a Jedi Knight. Will his master, Qui-Gon Jinn, let him move forward...or hold him back?",['Jude Watson'],Scholastic Paperbacks,2002,['Juvenile Fiction'],1.0,3.0,2002-04-08,Half a book,"It is hard to really say something specific about the book, because it presented me with many conflicting feelings.At the start it had almost the feeling of a return to the earlier books, where Obi Wan would face an unknown quest on an unfamiliar world, but then it turns into a stop-and-go, where the earlier books were just crammed full of story, and moved forwards at all times.I had the feeling that the book wanted to say much more than it could in the end. The series is coming to an end, while the padawan-master relationship isn't, not yet for several years.There is much reflection on earlier experiences, and at times I had the same feeling as I had during the Melida/Daan books. Towards the end it felt like the hopelessness and the pointlessness of an act of violence like running a plane through an officebuilding, was repeated here to make a point, which I believe is already well-taken. It felt like an addition, that forced other scenes to be left out. Many things are unexplained in the end, many threads left fluttering.What was the reason behind the retirees dying within weeks of their retirement? It felt like some sort of conspiracy, some dark secret at the start of the book, but it is left unexplained. There is a further remark made by the grandmother: ""We are not allowed to show such silliness. Especially not now."" Not now? Why? What changed? Pranks? Threats of war? Did not the fact that acts of silliness were not to be shown start the pranks in the first place? And did these not lead to threats of war?Bryn's unhappiness is remarked upon, but never really explained.Flip's turn to violence is explained, but what made Tray decide to nudge him into violence? She's the one with a true affection for her kin from first moment.Many things are left unsaid, which is probably the weakest point in the whole story.Were the young activists aware that their pranks were causing a threat of war with the other planet? They merely treated it as fun to distress their old and upset the rule of the day. Why were they never made to see the implications of their actions, especially in the light of their motto, that everything had to remain without violence.As a consequence of one of their pranks, a children's hospital computer system is nearly shut down, and young life is nearly lost. Why did Obi Wan did not pass on that bit of information, and let them proceed with a prank that had much more potential for disaster, and indeed did cost life.Why did Qui-Gon, who never spoke up, because he wished to put trust into his Padawan's plans, try to diffuse the situation between the two planets by presenting himself as an impartial party? He remains with the chairman of Vorzyd 4, and never once tries to talk in private with the Lady Felana, not even when she turns up at Vorzyd 4 and he could easily have taken her aside, to tell her, that he knew who was behind the attacks, and that she need not worry about the accusations of the chairman, since everything would solve itself out soon.Like the cover (though much much praise for mr Nielsen's continuing art) the title doesn't effectively speak for the book. I could not decide whether the threat within came from the young pranksters, or the establishment that did not want the change, or if there was an even deeper threat within either Qui-Gon or Obi Wan, as we see them sparring, apparently fighting eachother on the cover.At the end of the book we see them re-establishing their bond, while they were never really at odds in this particular book. But we know already that their personalities will keep complimenting eachother and clashing as well, until the very painful end, and as such this scene seems a bit out of place as well.I have often said, that the biggest problem with this, my favourite, series, is that the books are too short. It is the first time that I've finished one of its books with a feeling that I've only read half of it.",7,8

Middlesex [Unabridged Audiobook],"Spanning eight decades and chronicling the wild ride of a Greek-American family through the vicissitudes of the twentieth century, Jeffrey Eugenides’ witty, exuberant novel on one level tells a traditional story about three generations of a fantastic, absurd, lovable immigrant family -- blessed and cursed with generous doses of tragedy and high comedy. But there’s a provocative twist. Cal, the narrator -- also Callie -- is a hermaphrodite. And the explanation for this takes us spooling back in time, through a breathtaking review of the twentieth century, to 1922, when the Turks sacked Smyrna and Callie’s grandparents fled for their lives. Back to a tiny village in Asia Minor where two lovers, and one rare genetic mutation, set our narrator’s life in motion. Middlesex is a grand, utterly original fable of crossed bloodlines, the intricacies of gender, and the deep, untidy promptings of desire. It’s a brilliant exploration of divided people, divided families, divided cities and nations -- the connected halves that make up ourselves and our world.",['Jeffrey Eugenides'],Vintage Canada,2011,['Fiction'],353.0,4.0,2007-11-26,Totally satisfying.,"An engrossing read from start to finish.

The Fifth Discipline: The Art and Practice of the Learning Organization,"MORE THAN ONE MILLION COPIES IN PRINT • “One of the seminal management books of the past seventy-five years.”—Harvard Business Review This revised edition of the bestselling classic is based on fifteen years of experience in putting Peter Senge’s ideas into practice. As Senge makes clear, in the long run the only sustainable competitive advantage is your organization’s ability to learn faster than the competition. The leadership stories demonstrate the many ways that the core ideas of the Fifth Discipline, many of which seemed radical when first published, have become deeply integrated into people’s ways of seeing the world and their managerial practices. Senge describes how companies can rid themselves of the learning blocks that threaten their productivity and success by adopting the strategies of learning organizations, in which new and expansive patterns of thinking are nurtured, collective aspiration is set free, and people are continually learning how to create the results they truly desire. Mastering the disciplines Senge outlines in the book will: • Reignite the spark of genuine learning driven by people focused on what truly matters to them • Bridge teamwork into macrocreativity • Free you of confining assumptions and mindsets • Teach you to see the forest and the trees • End the struggle between work and personal time This updated edition contains more than one hundred pages of new material based on interviews with dozens of practitioners at companies such as BP, Unilever, Intel, Ford, HP, and Saudi Aramco and organizations such as Roca, Oxfam, and The World Bank.",['Peter M.

I found the book to be rather difficult to read through as to the fact that most of the content builds off theories over my head, however this is not a criticism of Senge, its just my lack of knowledge.

The Borrowers,Miniature people who live in an old country house by borrowing things from the humans are forced to emigrate from their home under the clock.,['Mary Norton'],Houghton Mifflin Harcourt,1998,['Juvenile Fiction'],60.0,5.0,1998-03-28,The Borrowers - a many layered classic,"The Borrowers is a book for losers. Not the modern kind of loser, but people like me who are always losing stamps and pins and pens. The book tells the story of Arrietty Clock and her parents, tiny people who live beneath the floor of an old house and `borrow' the things they need from the humans who live in the house above. A postage stamp becomes a painting for their wall, pins become knitting needles. Even Arrietty's parents' names - Pod and Homily - are borrowed.Life has never been easy for the borrowers, but now times are changing for the worse. The Sink family in the scullery, the Broom Cupboards, the Rain-Pipes and even Uncle Hendreary and his family have emigrated. Only the Clock family remain, living in fear of Mrs Driver, the housekeeper upstairs. When Pod comes home and says that a boy is living upstairs and that the boy has `seen' him, Pod's wife, Homily, is thrown into panic.Arrietty, however, is intrigued. While her parents cling to the dubious safety of the life they know, Arrietty wonders about the world outside and dreams of adventure. She persuades her reluctant parents to let her accompany her father on his borrowing expeditions. On her first venture out, she meets the boy upstairs. A dangerous friendship develops. Meanwhile, Mrs Driver stalks the borrowers, full of the sort of cruelty Roald Dahl would have been proud to create. It is only with the boy's help that Arrietty and her parents narrowly escape Mrs Driver's attempts to destroy them. At the end of the book, Arrietty faces the dangerous adventure of emigration.Like all great books for the young, The Borrowers can be read as an enthralling story of adventure, but also contains many layers of meaning. Mary Norton's creation of the tiny race of borrowers is an imaginative achievement in itself, but she does not stop there. She gives poignance to her tale by telling it through the voice of the boy's sister, now an old lady, who tells us at the start that her brother has long since grown up and died a `hero's de!ath' on the North-West frontier. The old lady seems to believe her brother's tale of the borrowers, and yet at the end of the book she provides evidence to suggest that the borrowers may have been nothing but a product of her brother's imagination. The reader is left wondering about reality and truth. On another level, in the relationship between the borrowers and the human world, parallels with the misunderstandings and confusions which occur between different cultures can be discerned. The uncertainties the borrowers face and their final exile mirror the plight of our world's increasing number of displaced people. Long after the book is finished, the characters and the questions their story raises reverberate around the mind. The Borrowers is a book which will fascinate, intrigue and entertain.",24,26

Then he whispers a few words in your ear and disappears, leaving you picking up the pieces of your shattered world. Adam Price has a lot to lose: a comfortable marriage to a beautiful woman, two wonderful sons, and all the trappings of the American Dream: a big house, a good job, a seemingly perfect life. Then he runs into the Stranger. When he learns a devastating secret about his wife, Corrine, he confronts her, and the mirage of perfection disappears as if it never existed at all. Soon Adam finds himself tangled in something far darker than even Corrine's deception, and realizes that if he doesn't make exactly the right moves, the conspiracy he's stumbled into will not only ruin lives - it will end them...",['Harlan Coben'],Orion,2016,[],15.0,5.0,2011-06-17,Peculiar and interesting read. Also a quick one.,"When I started reading the book, I had some buyer remorse because it's slow going early on. It's also written in an entirely different manner than I'm used to, so it took a bit. That said, I really enjoyed the main character, Mersault. Certainly a unique main character.Like others have stated, the first part of the book is slow compared to Part 2. However, the first part lays a lot of foundation for the second, so there is a point.This book is worth the purchase for a few reasons. For one, there's not much else like it in literature. If there is, I haven't read anything comparable. Second, it's a book that can and should be read more than once. That way, you get more of the context and underlying themes. Third, it's short enough that another read shouldn't take long at all.My only critique is the length of this book. Just when it gets interesting and I'm drawn all the way in, it's over. Small critique anyways, and that might be one of the finer points.",4,5
Ball Four,"The 50th Anniversary edition of “the book that changed baseball” (NPR), chosen by Time magazine as one of the “100 Greatest Non-Fiction” books. When Ball Four was published in 1970, it created a firestorm. Bouton was called a Judas, a Benedict Arnold, and a “social leper” for having violated the “sanctity of the clubhouse.” Baseball commissioner Bowie Kuhn tried to force Bouton to sign a statement saying the book wasn’t true. Ballplayers, most of whom hadn’t read it, denounced the book. It was even banned by a few libraries. Almost everyone else, however, loved Ball Four. Fans liked discovering that athletes were real people—often wildly funny people. David Halberstam, who won a Pulitzer for his reporting on Vietnam, wrote a piece in Harper’s that said of Bouton: “He has written . . . a book deep in the American vein, so deep in fact that it is by no means a sports book.” Today Ball Four has taken on another role—as a time capsule of life in the sixties. “It is not just a diary of Bouton’s 1969 season with the Seattle Pilots and Houston Astros,” says sportswriter Jim Caple. “It’s a vibrant, funny, telling history of an era that seems even further away than four decades. To call it simply a ‘tell all book’ is like describing The Grapes of Wrath as a book about harvesting peaches in California.” Includes a new foreword by Jim Bouton’s wife “An irreverent, best-selling book that angered baseball’s hierarchy and changed the way journalists and fans viewed the sports world.” —The Washington Post",['Jim Bouton'],Rosetta Books,2012,['Sports & Recreation'],1.0,5.0,2008-06-17,"Funny, Profane and Honest. Play Ball","This was a provocative book when it was first published. Jim Bouton, who had been a star pitcher for the New York Yankees, was trying to mount a comeback by working on a knuckleball in the bullpen of the expansion team Seattle Pilots less than five years later. He was a world away from pitching in two World Series in two successive seasons with players like Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris as team mates.His fastball could no longer shatter a pane of glass, but his astute observations about professional sports broke many barriers that had existed between the owners, players and the fans. Baseball Commissioner Bowie Kuhn publicly condemned the book.Bouton was traded to Houston before the season ended. The last place Seattle Pilots faded and died. The team was sold and transferred to Milwaukee after only one year. As such, it is something of a historic artifact of the failed Pilots team as well as a humorous look at the National Pastime.",3,3

God's Fool: The Life of Francis of Assisi (Perennial library),"Attempts to portray the complex personality of Saint Francis, looks at his early life and influences, and discusses the rules he developed for the Franciscan order of monks.",['Julien Green'],HarperCollins Publishers,1985,['Assisi (Italy)'],4.0,2.0,2001-02-07,A Very Good Book for Bringing Francis Down to Size,"This book is truly a mixed blessing. Let me first state that the principle of following Christ in the Gospel to the fullest extent is it's greatest, and almost only, asset. The other good thing about the book is that it does not hide who Francis was with his faults, before and after his conversion. Francis was a highly immoral youth and the leader in Assisi of immoral youth. Many other biographers try to hide this fact. Green must be commended for being truthful in this. After his conversion, he still had glaring faults which Green rightly exposes. What is truly disturbing about the book is the blind acceptance on the part of Francis of immoral ministers and his respect and submission to them. What is more disturbing is the fact that Francis considered the Word of God as virtually unneeded for his followers-and even dangerous to his cause. His own cause must then have been not God's cause, for God's cause is only found in the Bible and Francis wanted almost nothing to do with the Bible. He based his rule of order on randomly opening the Bible three times and pointing to verses (clearly a superstitious, and forbidden, approach to scripture). His knowledge of the Bible did not go much beyond these three passages. He forbid his followers to have a Bible or even a Psalter (which contains the inspired praises of God) with which to sing because he felt that even too much knowledge of the Bible was dangerous to spirituality. Francis nor Green evidently ever read Romans 10:17. In fact, Green makes it clear that Francis knew virtually nothing of what the Bible says. In essence, Francis forbid his followers to learn from the only book that could guide them in God's will. Although Green sought to present a good, honest presentation of Francis for the purpose of promoting the Franciscan way of life, he actually gives every reason not to follow the Franciscan way. The Franciscan way, according to Francis, and as accurately reported by Green, is to know as little of the Bible as possible and to submit to known immoral ministers. What is most dangerous about the positive approach to this book is it's promotion of Francis' salvation by earning it and purchasing it (which the Bible clearly denies as possible), and it's promotion of Francis' salvation by means other than the only one given by God--free mercy fully purchased by Christ alone. Francis' failure to know the Gospel as found in the Bible and thus teach another gospel is strong evidence to his ignorance of God and His truth as a whole. This book is an important text in learning the truth about Francis of Assisi. One must read it with great discernment, for in accurately portraying the philosophy of Francis, it also accurately exposed Francis' complete denial of what the Bible teaches about salvation and many other important doctrines. Green shows that Francis denied the use of the Bible, probably to the eternal detriment of his and his followers' souls. Mr. Green has accomplished in this book what he did not intend: an exposure of the Franciscan way as unbiblical and as a way that denies the Bible of the very God they claimed to worship and follow. Mr. Green shows much of the reason why Martin Luther nailed his 95 theses to the Wittenburg door. Mr. Green, thank you for being open enough to reveal the truth, even the truth that exposes Francis of Assisi as someone other than you see him to be. This book gets 5 stars for exposing the truth of Francis of Assisi, and 1 star for being a book that can be trusted to lead people into the truth of the Bible.",9,54

"A Literate Passion: Letters of Anais Nin and Henry Miller, 1932-1953",This selection of letters from the correspondence of Henry Miller and Anais Nin documents twenty years of their fifty-year relationship--a relationship that began as a passionate love affair and grew to be an enduring friendship,"['Anaïs Nin', 'Henry Miller']",Houghton Mifflin Harcourt,1989,['Biography & Autobiography'],3.0,5.0,2001-11-23,Spying In The House of Love,"Like many others, I have been fascinated with and frustrated by Anais Nin for many years, since reading the first volume of her expurgated diary in 1977.This volume of letters enables the reader who has already read other versions of the Nin-Miller story to form additional conclusions about what might actually have happened. Because the letters were sent into the possession of others, they were less subject to the constant revision and reinvention that bedevils all attempts to determine objective facts about the mercurial Nin.If you are not already an amateur historian of literary trends of the 1930's, fear not. The letters are worth reading as an introduction to Anais Nin and Henry Miller as well, for they depict a real-life romance conducted by two who absolutely relished the game and were highly articulate in dramatically different ways.",11,11
Trump: How To Get Rich,"The famed real-estate and media mogul draws on his own personal experiences to explain how to negotiate, manage, create, and keep personal wealth in the new economy. Reprint.","['Donald Trump', 'Meredith McIver']","Random House Digital, Inc.",2004,['Business & Economics'],3.0,2.0,2004-04-18,Characteristic Bravado,"Before reading this book you have to understand is that with Trump what you see is what you get. If you decide to take him seriously then indeed he does display the characteristics of an arrogant, self-serving business leader. However, if you take this book for what it is, a how to guide that's made to entertain, you can get much more out of it. Some of the more useful aspects of the book come from the chapters where he talks about his daily activities, including his habit of reading from 5 am to 8 am. Without reading the book you really wouldn't have known that the Donald was a vociferous reader or that he doesn't gamble, smoke, or drink, although his business ventures encourage the gambling.When it talks about doing what he loves in business and the advantages that it has on people, it's pretty clear that he lives in his own little world. With 20,000 people in his organization and a flurry of personal assistants shielding him from the thoughts of America, it's pretty evident that he'll be continually acting this way for the rest of these days. If you haven't seen the Dateline special in which he is interviewed about the book, one quote is worth remembering. Stone Philips asks him about his chapter imploring people to get a prenuptial agreement to which he responses &quot;if I hadn't had those strong prenups I wouldn't be speaking with you today, unless you were doing a special on losers.&quot; Now I don't know how he feels in real life, but that in itself was entertaining. Anyway, save your money and just know that even people at the top spend a good amount of their time during the day reading, a practice we can all learn from the Donald.",7,7
The Rosetta Codex,"Cale Alexandros was five years old when the path of his life was irrevocably altered. As the scion of a wealthy and powerful family, he enjoyed a privileged existence—until his family’s starship was attacked en route to Morningstar, the lone outpost of civilization on a savage planet known as Conrad’s World. In an escape ship, Cale crash-landed in the wilds, and was picked from the wreckage by nomads. For years, Cale is forced to endure life as a slave, sold and shuffled from one group of brutish thugs to another—until a trader recognizes a glimmer of promise in Cale’s eyes, and frees him. Cale travels far and wide, but he never forgets what happened long ago, in the desert wastes . . . when, in a strange, ancient temple, he found a book with pages made of a strange metal, and writings he could not identify. When he finally reaches Morningstar, he comes to realize that the book is a key to understanding a language never heard by mankind, an alien dialect. It also holds a secret that some people want to learn, a treasure that some want for themselves, and a revelation that some will do anything to control.",['Richard Paul Russo'],Penguin,2005,['Fiction'],1.0,5.0,2008-05-06,The Most Enjoyable Sci-Fi Book I've Read in a Long Time,"Just finished reading this book and I have to say it was one of the most enjoyable sci-fi reads I've had in a long time. Yes, it's low-key, less on gadgets and more on world- and character-building, but I could not put it down. One of those books I looked forward to returning to again and again. The first half was more a coming-of-age tale, surreal in places, reminiscent of the early Dark Tower books by King. In the second half, everything comes together in a sort of pre-ordained destiny for the main character. The characters themselves were well-drawn, never stale, always interesting, and the many worlds and settings fascinating. The ending, I felt, was very satsifying. Russo's style is steady, and consistently good, reminding me very much of the writing of Ben Bova, another favorite of mine. As this is my first Richard Paul Russo novel, I'm looking forward to picking up another very soon.",1,2
Light a penny candle,"The chaotic events of World War II force Elizabeth White, a shy, young English girl, to escape to Ireland, where she shares a friendship with Aisling O'Connor, with whom she endures years of change, joy, sorrow, soaring dreams, bitter betrayals, and an unbreakable bond. Reissue.",['Maeve Binchy'],Penguin,2001,['Family & Relationships'],16.0,5.0,2002-09-16,A Tale of Friendship,"I gather this is the first novel written by Binchy, more than 20 years ago, and only now I had the chance of purchasing and reading it. Well, our beloved Irish author was born with a genuine storyteller's knack then, because her first novel is as good as any more recent one such as &quot;Tara Road&quot; - sometimes we can notice slight improvements in some writers throughout the years, but not Binchy, she had a perfect start and never disappointed us since then. &quot;Light a Penny Candle&quot; tells us the story of two girls from two different families and backgrounds who are brought together due to historical circumstances and become very good friends, the best ones. They'll go through difficult times, but they have each other, so they can overcome anything. It's a good idea to have a handkerchief or a box of tissues near you, you'll need them specially in the beginning chapters. After the main characters have grown up you expect them to be stronger - maybe the hankerchiefs and tissues won't be necessary at later stages - but you'll never lose interest in the series of events.The story is neatly organized into four parts from 1940 until 1960. The more recent edition from Signet also brings an excerpt of &quot;Scarlet Feather&quot;, her latest novel before &quot;Quentins&quot;. That is very nice indeed, because after savouring &quot;Light a Penny Candle&quot; you have this extra appetizer as well. I read somewhere that Binchy has &quot;an army of fans&quot; - lovely metaphor. I'm sure she does, and down here in Brazil I've got to say that I am the General of her South American army.",3,3
Knight : My Story,"Bob Knight was a head coach in college basketball at twenty-four, coach of an unbeaten NCAA champion at thirty-five, coach of the last amateur team to win the Olympic men's basketball gold medal at forty-three, and out of a job at not quite sixty. His shock, disappointment and anger over Indiana University's manner of firing a twenty-nine-year employee comes through clearly in his account of his last turbulent year there. And it is his account. Few people in sports have had more books written about them. This is the first by Bob Knight - one of the most literate, candid, quoted and outspoken men in American public life telling in this first-person account of his full, rich life. Much of that life has been in basketball, most of it because of basketball, but it also has brought him forward as a coach who has proved academic responsibility and production of championship college athletic teams not only can co-exist but should. His excitement as things start anew for him at Texas Tech is matched here by his characteristic frankness and remarkable recollection of a life he clearly has enjoyed. You'll see why, as he tells story after story - some delightful, some hilarious, some poignant, none of them dull. Knight, as a sophomore front-line reserve on the Ohio State team that won the NCAA championship, became the first man to play on and coach a championship team when he led his 1975-76 Indiana team to a 32-0 season that was capped by an 86-68 victory over Michigan in the NCAA championship game at Philadelphia. His Indiana teams in 1980-81 and 1986-87 also won NCAA titles, making him one of just four coaches in history to win as many as three championships. Twenty-six years later, the 1975-76 Indiana team still stands as the last unbeaten team in major- college men's basketball. Knight's coaching career includes six seasons at Army, where his teams - during the years when the Vietnam War made recruiting for West Point difficult - won 102 games and lost 50. He is one of five coaches who have won seven hundred games, and the only coach whose teams have won championships in the NCAA tournament, the National Invitation Tournament, the Olympic Games and the Pan American Games. During all that he has been at the heart of more controversies while running a winning and squeaky-clean program than any coach of any sport any time or anywhere. His excitement as things start anew for him is matched here by his candor and remarkable recollection of a life he clearly has enjoyed. You'll see why, with story after story - some delightful, some hilarious, some poignant, none of them dull: the story of Bob Knight's life.","['Bob Knight', 'Bob Hammel']",Macmillan,2002,['Biography & Autobiography'],2.0,5.0,2003-11-19,Bob Knight's Story,"Bob Knight grew up in a small town in Ohio. There he was involved in other sports besides basketball, such as football and baseball. He was a highly successful athlete in all three sports that he played. He was a starter at all three.Although he was very good in high school, he was very average in college. He was on a very good Ohio State basketball team. He didn't get to play much, but he understood how to play better than the rest. While playing there his team won the national championship. That team came close a couple of other times, but fell a little short.After his college career, he was a high school assistant coach for a couple of years. Then he decided to take the coaching position of the freshmen at West Point for two years. After the head coach at Army left, he got the head coaching job. While he was there, his teams were pretty successful. His main goal was to win the NIT. They got close to it, but didn't. He was the head coach there for six years.After spending eight years at Army, he left to take the head coaching job at Indiana. While there he met some extremely successful coaches. He had to ""clean up"" the basketball program. He won three national championships, several Big Ten championships, the NIT, the Pan-Am games, and an Olympic gold medal. His 1976 national champion team was the last team ever to go undefeated throughout the entire season. He spent an amazing twenty-nine years as Indiana's head coach, the longest by any of the other Big Ten college coaches. He was then fired under a ""zero-tolerance"" policy before his thirtieth season as Indiana's head coach. He is now the new head coach at Texas Tech University.I thought this book was outstanding. What makes it so great is that it is coming straight from Coach Knight. Anyone who is interested in sports would love this book because it isn't just about basketball. It is about an extremely successful college coach and his will to win. Whether you love him or hate him, you can't ignore his number of wins. I loved this book and would recommend it to anyone and every one who enjoys sports.",1,2
Under Deadman's Skin: Discovering the Meaning of Children's Violent Play,"The five-and six-year-olds in my class have invented a new game they call suicide. I have never seen a game I hate so much in which all the children involved are so happy. So begins Under Deadman's Skin, a deceptively simple-and compellingly readable-teachers' tale. Jane Katch, in the tradition of Vivian Paley and Jonathan Kozol, uses her student's own vocabulary and storytelling to set the scene: a class of five-and six-year-olds obsessed with what is to their teacher hatefully violent fantasy play. Katch asks, 'Can I make a place in school for understanding these fantasies, instead of shutting them out?' Over the course of the year she holds group discussions to determine what kind of play creates or calms turmoil; she illustrates (or rather the children illustrate) the phenomenon of very young children needing to make sense of exceptionally violent imagery; and she consults with older grade-school boys who remember what it was like to be obsessed by violence and tell Katch what she can do to help. Katch's classroom journey-one that leads her to rules and limits that keep children secure-is an enabling blueprint for any teacher or parent disturbed by violent children's play.",['Jane Katch'],Beacon Press,2002,['Education'],2.0,4.0,2008-02-13,Interesting insight,This book gives an interesting insight into the minds of children...especially boys.

The Tragedy of Great Power Politics,"Presents the author's theory of ""offensive realism,"" declaring the post-Cold War visions of international peace and prosperity unrealistic and explaining how great power politics force states to seek dominance at one another's expense. Reprint.",['John J. Mearsheimer'],W. W. Norton & Company,2003,['Political Science'],4.0,5.0,2006-02-17,Incredibly Unassailable Argument,"First off, I'd like to say that I don't at all like Mr. Mearsheimer's thesis, nor the conclusions he draws. ""Tragedy"" is truly the perfect word to describe his theories. However, I have found the arguments to be so rock-solidly based on reality that I have had to put my feelings and opinions aside to accept the state of affairs that he brings forth.Incredibly, his summarization of nearly 300 years of European history via the ""offensive realism"" lens explains many abberations throughout the history of human warfare. Most poignant of these is American involvement in WWII, coming as it did AFTER the near capitulation of all anti-German powers save Russia, effectively allowing Germany to crush any possible anti-American sentiment and resistance before American involvement was even an issue. I know a reviewer questioned why the US allowed Europe to exist as a separate political entity after the war, but if you take Mr. Mearsheimer's arguments that armies hold land belonging to the hegemonic power, then the question no longer exists. America's military reach has now expanded not just in Germany and Japan, but also in Korea, the Philippines, England, Turkey, Greece, Saudi Arabia, and recently Afghanistan and Iraq. If these armies constitute the ""borders"" of the American hegemony, then the only domains not completely covered are South America, Africa, parts of Central-South-East Asia, and most importantly, Russia/China -- everything else is under the American sphere of influence. This is exactly the point of Mr. Mearsheimer's theory - aggressive, hegemonic states such as America will not rest until all other threats are neutralized.To explain why these satellite political entities (Europe, sections of the Middle-East, Japan and Korea) are allowed to exist despite over-arching American conventional/nuclear power, I point readers to Joseph Nye's book ""The Paradox of American Power"" as a supplement to Mr. Mearsheimer's book. Not only must civilizations be subject to the military might of the hegemon, they must also be allowed to economically participate and express via their own cultures their approval of America's dominant culture - or ""soft power,"" as Mr. Nye puts it. Such ""soft power"" may explain why even though terrorists held a Korean hostage on world television and subsequently executed him after he begged and pleaded for his life, 3000 Korean troops left the next week for Iraq with nearly no political repercussions at America's request. How much clearer an example is needed of America's near hegemonic power over Korea's body politic? Is it that hard to compare this state of affairs to England, Germany, Japan, or even Saudi Arabia, and find similarities?Another potent combination of these two theories may extend to the South-East Asian financial crisis and Long Term Capital Management. LTCM effectively destroyed economies surrounding China's coast along with Russia in what may be seen as an economic attack on the entire region, at the cost of a mere $100 billion bailout by private banks, or only 5% of the US government annual budget. The regions have since recovered, no doubt due to the resilience of one of the the intended targets: China, as evidence by CNOOC's strong challenge to Unocal's South-East Asian oil fields last year.Mr. Mearsheimer's conclusion -- that despite America's isolationist and anti-war ideology and rhetoric, it still follows with amazing accuracy his theory of offensive realism --is self-evident when considering America's military reach, and the fact that America has the only effective nuclear arsenal capable of vaporizing all life on this planet, with no plans of diminishing this capability. America does not need to be accomodating in world politics, because America knows that it alone has the power to ensure it is the only one standing in any fight. Truly a pyrrhic victory, and truly a tragedy in the making.This book, along with Mr. Nye's, is a must-read, not to feel good, but to feel informed of the current state of world politics. The most chilling aspect of Mr. Mearsheimer's argument is the historical precedence he continually illustrates to back his views. America may truly become what Germany, France, and England could not - a global hegemony.",21,27

Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed),"A literary sensation and runaway bestseller, this brilliant debut novel tells with seamless authenticity and exquisite lyricism the true confessions of one of Japan's most celebrated geisha. Nominated as one of America’s best-loved novels by PBS’s The Great American Read Speaking to us with the wisdom of age and in a voice at once haunting and startlingly immediate, Nitta Sayuri tells the story of her life as a geisha. It begins in a poor fishing village in 1929, when, as a nine-year-old girl with unusual blue-gray eyes, she is taken from her home and sold into slavery to a renowned geisha house. We witness her transformation as she learns the rigorous arts of the geisha: dance and music; wearing kimono, elaborate makeup, and hair; pouring sake to reveal just a touch of inner wrist; competing with a jealous rival for men's solicitude and the money that goes with it. In Memoirs of a Geisha, we enter a world where appearances are paramount; where a girl's virginity is auctioned to the highest bidder; where women are trained to beguile the most powerful men; and where love is scorned as illusion.

A Species in Denial,"A SPECIES IN DENIAL is the revolutionary bestseller by Australian biologist Jeremy Griffith. In it the author presents a series of essays addressesing the crux issue before us as a species of the human condition, our capacity for good and evil, describing how humans have coped with the dilemma of the human condition by living in denial of it. Griffith then explains the biological reason for the human condition, thus ending the need for the denial and maturing humanity to psychological freedom from its historic insecure human-condition-afflicted state. With a foreword by Templeton Prize winning biologist Charles Birch, this book provides a deeply insightful examination of science, religion, politics, men and women, psychiatry and mythology.

Girls' Poker Night: A Novel of High Stakes,"Dissatisfied both with writing a “Single Girl on the Edge/ Ledge/Verge” lifestyle column and with her boyfriend (who has a name for his car and compulsively collects plastic bread ties), Ruby Capote sends her best columns and a six-pack of beer to the editor of The New York News and lands herself a new job in a new city. In New York, Ruby undertakes the venerable tradition of Poker Night—a way (as men have always known) to eat, drink, smoke, analyze, interrupt one another, share stories, and, most of all, raise the stakes. There’s Skorka, model by profession, homewrecker by vocation; Jenn, willing to cross county lines for true love; Danielle, recently divorced, seducer of at least one father/son combo in her quest to make up for perceived “missed opportunities.” When Ruby falls for her boss, Michael, all bets are off. He’s a challenge. He’s her editor. And he wants her to stop being quippy and clever and become the writer—and the woman—he knows she can be. Adding to Ruby’s uncertainty is his amazing yet ambiguous kiss in the elevator, and the enjoyably torturous impasse of he-loves-me, he-loves-me-not. What happens when you realize that Mr. Right has his own unresolved past? Where does that leave the future you envisioned? Ruby knows that happy endings aren’t for cowards, and she hasn’t lost hope that there are risks worth taking.

The dialogue, especially Carter's interior dialogue was clunky, repetitive and unconvincing. Many of the events seemed labored and over the top. Did her husband Kim really have to be a Nazi and involved in the occult, and in perverse sex? Themes were pushed hard instead being more quietly illustrated by the story itself.

Centering on the infamous World War II firebombing of Dresden, the novel is the result of what Kurt Vonnegut described as a twenty-three-year struggle to write a book about what he had witnessed as an American prisoner of war. It combines historical fiction, science fiction, autobiography, and satire in an account of the life of Billy Pilgrim, a barber’s son turned draftee turned optometrist turned alien abductee. As Vonnegut had, Billy experiences the destruction of Dresden as a POW. Unlike Vonnegut, he experiences time travel, or coming “unstuck in time.” An instant bestseller, Slaughterhouse-Five made Kurt Vonnegut a cult hero in American literature, a reputation that only strengthened over time, despite his being banned and censored by some libraries and schools for content and language. But it was precisely those elements of Vonnegut’s writing—the political edginess, the genre-bending inventiveness, the frank violence, the transgressive wit—that have inspired generations of readers not just to look differently at the world around them but to find the confidence to say something about it. Authors as wide-ranging as Norman Mailer, John Irving, Michael Crichton, Tim O’Brien, Margaret Atwood, Elizabeth Strout, David Sedaris, Jennifer Egan, and J. K. Rowling have all found inspiration in Vonnegut’s words. Jonathan Safran Foer has described Vonnegut as “the kind of writer who made people—young people especially—want to write.” George Saunders has declared Vonnegut to be “the great, urgent, passionate American writer of our century, who offers us . . . a model of the kind of compassionate thinking that might yet save us from ourselves.” Fifty years after its initial publication at the height of the Vietnam War, Vonnegut's portrayal of political disillusionment, PTSD, and postwar anxiety feels as relevant, darkly humorous, and profoundly affecting as ever, an enduring beacon through our own era’s uncertainties. “Poignant and hilarious, threaded with compassion and, behind everything, the cataract of a thundering moral statement.”—The Boston Globe",['Kurt Vonnegut'],Dial Press Trade Paperback,1999,['Fiction'],1523.0,2.0,2000-04-09,Where's the Beef?,"I have read many works of fiction and nonfiction in my days, and have avoided most writers who dabble in so called &quot;science fiction&quot; for reasons that became glaringly obvious to me after finishing this book. After reading several reviews I was willing to take a stab at this book, and was ready to &quot;stab&quot; the book at its conclusion. I found this story to be profoundly dull and lacked the necessary ingredients to entertain a well read and intelligent mind. Why so many people think so highly of this book is a mystery I shall never hope to solve, probably not even on Tralfamadore. I found very little humor in it, and the wit was dry and unimaginative to say the least. I would strongly recommend anyone who thought they have read a profound piece of work in this book to turn their attentions to the brilliant prose of Thomas Hardy and then draw their conclusions. I am sure I will be able to forget this book in about 3 days, if not I will try to suffocate the memories with books worthy of an intellectual mind.",1,18

The genius of this book is that it . . . asks politically incorrect questions about men and women at home—the neglected front in the gender wars."" —New York Times ""The insights in this book reveal a new and effective way for men and women to understand and appreciate each other. It shows what it really takes to create a loving and lasting relationship."" —John Gray, author, Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus Marriage and relationships are in crisis. The breakup and divorce rate remain incredibly high, despite all the couples therapy, afternoon talk shows, and other books in the marketplace, many of which describe men as abusive commitment phobic creeps who'd better change fast or else. But this new book is totally different, a whole different way of looking at how to build a successful long-lasting relationship from a man's point of view, men who are happy in their partnerships, who have figured out what works for them in accomplishing the goal of a loving, intimate, lifetime commitment. Dr. Scott Haltzman, Clinical Assistant Professor of Psychiatry and Human Behavior at Brown University, and founder of www.secretsofmarriedmen.com, has devised a proven method for improving relationships, based on a man's special and unique skills, strengths, powers—as a responsible and motivated worker, manager, leader, problem-solver, partner, husband, and father. Men are different, Dr. Haltzman says. They don't approach relationships with the same skills and techniques that women do—and viva la difference. Dr.Haltzman therefore lays out eight ways, tasks, proven techniques which men have revealed in confidential correspondence to his highly successful website, including The First Way: Make Your Marriage Your Job, The Second Way: Know Your Wife, The Third Way: Be Home Now, The Fourth Way: Expect Conflict and Deal With It, The Fifth Way: Learn to Listen, The Sixth Way: Aim to Please, The Seventh Way: Understand the Truth About Sex, The Eighth Way: Introduce Yourself, and finally, Celebrate Your Love. Within each of these steps, he provides both specific analysis, guidelines and techniques based on male biology, neuro-science, brain differences, unique developmental stages from youth to seniority. To illustrate these ideas in action, he's included wonderful true stories, anecdotes, and confessions from the website. The result is a practical, very entertaining, totally original way to build successful relationships for men and their partners, girlfriends, and wives. For a lasting commitment, a continuing guide to solving inevitable problems and bumps in the road, for more fun, better sex, genuine intimacy, and a life-long partnership—this dynamic new author shows t",['Scott Haltzman'],John Wiley & Sons,2010,['Family & Relationships'],1.0,5.0,2013-02-17,Awesome book,"This book is awesome everyone should read this book, easily to read and easily to understand how the opposite thinks and work",1,1

His mother, June, hardly welcomes him back with open arms, and is no stranger to infidelity herself; she's tired of being the long-suffering wife thanks to her husband's many affairs. Within days of March's arrival, someone is dead, marriages are upended, and even the strongest of allies are divided. In the end, the ties that hold them together might be exactly what drag them all down. The Briscoes must reckon with their choices, their capacity for forgiveness, and the confines of family.

Michener gave just enough detail that I could picture the battle as it unfolded and the events surrounding it (ex.

She is carving out a life for her and her daughters despite the hostility and greed of her in-laws. But when Gregory is captured in France and held for ransom, Margaret knows she must take action... With in-laws as tight-fisted as hers, she must rely on old friends Mother Hilde, the herbalist, and Brother Malachi, an alchemist on a quest for the secret of changing base metals into gold. Together the trio plan to rescue Gregory and bring him back to London, where he and Margaret can start a new life away from his meddling family. Margaret will not only need her special gift of healing, her quick mind, and her independent spirit but the loyalty of her friends and the love of her new husband to carry them all safely home.

I thought it was fantastic. After years of searching for the book & forgetting the title, I finally tracked it down. I assumed that I'd love it just as much now as I did then. While I did like the book, I wasn't as enchanted with it as I was as a kid.The book follows Margaret of Ashbury as she narrates her tale to the reluctant monk Gregory, who initially assumes that her tale will simply be a normal tale of a medieval wife. When he discovers that Margaret's stories contain bits about her having miraculous visions & events, he initially refuses to believe it. He continues the stories & a friendship of sorts begins to blossom between the two of them.The synopsis above really is an overly simplified version of the initial part of the book. Giving anything else would really be too much of a spoiler for my tastes.Now I'm sort of torn between giving this 3 stars & giving it 4 stars. As a kid I would have immediately given this 5 stars, yet when I re-read it I viewed it as more of a 3.5 read. My vote of 4 stars is sort of a compromise, I guess. I liked the character of Margaret & I was able to get into her stories, but I found upon re-reading it that I really didn't care overly much for the character of Gregory as much as I did as a kid.Over all, this is a book worth reading for the most part. I wasn't as enchanted with the sequels, but this book itself is worth checking out.",0,0
Wuthering Heights (College classics in English),"HarperCollins is proud to present a range of best-loved, essential classics.",['Emily Brontë'],HarperCollins UK,2010,['Fiction'],2.0,4.0,2011-12-13,The ultimate dysfunctional family,"It's unfortunate that Wuthering Heights often gets lumped into the category of Victorian chick lit, because it probably has more in common with Dickens or Balzac than with Jane Austen. The various film adaptations often make much of the love between Heathcliff and Catherine, but that doesn't begin to cover the scope of this book. Wuthering Heights is no conventional romance novel. It is in fact an epic examination of human wickedness involving an ensemble cast that spans two generations over the course of almost 50 years. Filled with powerful imagery and unforgettable characters, it makes for a profoundly entertaining read.Heathcliff, a gypsy-looking street urchin from Liverpool, is adopted by the Earnshaw family, who live among the moors of northern England at the secluded estate of Wuthering Heights. Mr. Earnshaw treats Heathcliff as his favorite, much to the consternation of his eldest son Hindley. When the father dies, Hindley seizes the opportunity to retaliate against Heathcliff, revoking his favored family position and forcing him to labor in the fields. Meanwhile, Heathcliff and his adopted sister Catherine develop a love for each other, but due to his servant status, dirty boots, and surly demeanor, she spurns him for her more elegant and refined neighbor Edgar Linton. Heathcliff resolves to revenge himself upon all who have hurt him, and the following generation of Earnshaws, Lintons, and Heathcliffs must also suffer the repercussions of his passionate vengeance.The joy of Wuthering Heights is that there isn't a single character in the book who could be described as a good person. They are all at best selfish and petty, at worst deplorably evil. All are set on destroying each other, not through murder or violence, but by making each other's lives a living hell until one by one they gradually drop dead of sorrow or destitution. Emily Bronte's unrelenting audacity in depicting the cruelest, basest aspects of humanity is so refreshing it's a joy to read. Yet over and above its sensationalistic pleasures, Wuthering Heights is undeniably a meaningful piece of literature with an intricately constructed plot and keen insights into human nature. It offers important lessons on the poisoning effects of resentment and vengeance upon the soul, as well as the resilience of the human spirit to rise above adversity and degradation.The one drawback of Wuthering Heights is its narrative voice, as told through the perspective of a visitor, Mr. Lockwood, which results in some rather convoluted constructions (Lockwood says that Nelly said that Cathy read in a letter that Linton wrote that Heathcliff told Hareton . . . ).

To Kill A Mockingbird,"Voted America's Best-Loved Novel in PBS's The Great American Read Harper Lee's Pulitzer Prize-winning masterwork of honor and injustice in the deep South—and the heroism of one man in the face of blind and violent hatred One of the most cherished stories of all time, To Kill a Mockingbird has been translated into more than forty languages, sold more than forty million copies worldwide, served as the basis for an enormously popular motion picture, and was voted one of the best novels of the twentieth century by librarians across the country. A gripping, heart-wrenching, and wholly remarkable tale of coming-of-age in a South poisoned by virulent prejudice, it views a world of great beauty and savage inequities through the eyes of a young girl, as her father—a crusading local lawyer—risks everything to defend a black man unjustly accused of a terrible crime.",['Harper Lee'],Harper Collins,2014,['Fiction'],2164.0,5.0,2006-12-20,To Kill a Mockingbird,"To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee is an interesting book that shows how life was in Alabama during the 1930's.

Transitions : Making Sense of Life's Changes,"The best-selling guide for coping with changes in life and work, named one of the 50 all-time best books in self-help and personal development Whether you choose it or it is thrust upon you, change brings both opportunities and turmoil. Since Transitions was first published, this supportive guide has helped hundreds of thousands of readers cope with these issues by providing an elegantly simple yet profoundly insightful roadmap of the transition process. With the understanding born of both personal and professional experience, William Bridges takes readers step by step through the three stages of any transition: The Ending, The Neutral Zone, and, eventually, The New Beginning. Bridges explains how each stage can be understood and embraced, leading to meaningful and productive movement into a hopeful future. With a new introduction highlighting how the advice in the book continues to apply and is perhaps even more relevant today, and a new chapter devoted to change in the workplace, Transitions will remain the essential guide for coping with the one constant in life: change.",['William Bridges'],Da Capo Lifelong Books,2004,['Psychology'],1.0,5.0,2009-10-14,A book to share with others,"I have read this book several times and I am amazed how neither the text or the power of Bridge's insights lose their meaning.

How transitions sometimes occur with or without our knowledge or consent. How something inside us (perceptions, ideas, values) or outside (job or person loss) must come to an end in some small or major triggering event in order for transition to occur and move us to another emotional or physical place.If I had to be on a deserted island, this would be one of the books I'd want with me.

We Die Alone,"We Die Alone recounts one of the most exciting escape stories to emerge from the challenges and miseries of World War II. In March 1943, a team of expatriate Norwegian commandos sailed from northern England for Nazi-occupied arctic Norway to organize and supply the Norwegian resistance. But they were betrayed and the Nazis ambushed them. Only one man survived--Jan Baalsrud. This is the incredible and gripping story of his escape.Frostbitten and snowblind, pursued by the Nazis, he dragged himself on until he reached a small arctic village. He was near death, delirious, and a virtual cripple. But the villagers, at mortal risk to themselves, were determined to save him, and--through impossible feats--they did.We Die Alone is an astonishing true story of heroism and endurance.

Devil Take The Hindmost: A History Of Financial Speculation,"A lively, original, and challenging history of stock market speculation from the 17th century to present day. Is your investment in that new Internet stock a sign of stock market savvy or an act of peculiarly American speculative folly? How has the psychology of investing changed—and not changed—over the last five hundred years? In Devil Take the Hindmost, Edward Chancellor traces the origins of the speculative spirit back to ancient Rome and chronicles its revival in the modern world: from the tulip scandal of 1630s Holland, to “stockjobbing” in London's Exchange Alley, to the infamous South Sea Bubble of 1720, which prompted Sir Isaac Newton to comment, “I can calculate the motion of heavenly bodies, but not the madness of people.” Here are brokers underwriting risks that included highway robbery and the “assurance of female chastity”; credit notes and lottery tickets circulating as money; wise and unwise investors from Alexander Pope and Benjamin Disraeli to Ivan Boesky and Hillary Rodham Clinton. From the Gilded Age to the Roaring Twenties, from the nineteenth century railway mania to the crash of 1929, from junk bonds and the Japanese bubble economy to the day-traders of the Information Era, Devil Take the Hindmost tells a fascinating story of human dreams and folly through the ages.",['Edward Chancellor'],Penguin,2000,['Business & Economics'],2.0,5.0,2012-11-29,the best book on speculative bubbles,"This book explains the history of various bubbles and details various lessons learned from them. For example, the author discusses how bubbles always over-develop the industry subject to the bubble and how unemployment then results using the example of the railroad industry in 19th century England.The three English railroad companies each built a line from Liverpool to London, and in the speculative hysteria and paranoia each railroad company also built an alternate line in case the main line broke down. The alternate lines were also run full time. After the bubble burst, however, there was only enough business for one railroad line. Hence, five of the six lines had to be closed. For that reason, five sets of railroad crews, including engineers, cooks, porters, mechanics, etc. were laid off. Of course, these human resources were only brought into the railroad industry by the over-development, and the resulting unemployment would not have developed without it.I grew up in Silicon Valley and lived there at the time of the bursting of the dot com bubble. I would say I saw the events in Silicon Valley follow the author's lessons learned almost to the tee.",1,1

Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes,"The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes is a collection of Sherlock Holmes stories, originally published in 1894, by Arthur Conan Doyle. The first London edition of the Memoirs in 1894 did not include ""The Adventure of the Cardboard Box"", although all twelve stories had appeared in the Strand Magazine. The first U.S. edition did include the story, but it was very quickly replaced with a revised edition that omitted it. The reasoning behind the suppression is unclear. In Britain the story was apparently removed at Doyle's request as it included adultery and so was unsuitable for younger readers. This may have also been the cause for the rapid removal of the story from the U.S. edition, and some sources[specify] state that the publishers believed the story was too scandalous for the American public. As a result, this story was not republished in the U.S. until many years later, when it was added to His Last Bow. Even today, most American editions of the canon include it with His Last Bow, while most British editions keep the story in its original place in The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes. Additionally, when the story was removed from the Memoirs, its opening pages, where Holmes emulates Dupin, were transferred to the beginning of ""The Adventure of the Resident Patient"". In some later U.S. editions of the Memoirs, which still omit ""The Adventure of the Cardboard Box"", this transfer still appears. reference : Wikipedia, The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes","['SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE', 'Choi Hyun']",ebookspub,2016,[],20.0,5.0,2013-02-18,5/5,"Sherlock Holmes is always amazing!

Wittgenstein's Mistress,"Wittgenstein's Mistress is a novel unlike anything David Markson or anyone else has ever written before. It is the story of a woman who is convinced and, astonishingly, will ultimately convince the reader as well that she is the only person left on earth. Presumably she is mad. And yet so appealing is her character, and so witty and seductive her narrative voice, that we will follow her hypnotically as she unloads the intellectual baggage of a lifetime in a series of irreverent meditations on everything and everybody from Brahms to sex to Heidegger to Helen of Troy. And as she contemplates aspects of the troubled past which have brought her to her present state--obviously a metaphor for ultimate loneliness--so too will her drama become one of the few certifiably original fictions of our time. ""The novel I liked best this year,"" said the Washington Times upon the book's publication; ""one dizzying, delightful, funny passage after another . . .

Maximum Bob.,"“Hilarious….Strange and risky….A right-on, pitch perfect novel, with wide social scope, comic genius, page-burning storytelling magic, and juicy characters who wrench your heart and gut.” —Washington Post Book World A character so outrageous he could only have come from the ingenious imagination of Elmore Leonard, lewd, lecherous, law-bending Florida jurist Judge Robert “Maximum Bob” Gibbs has been judged guilty by a grudge-bearing malefactor and sentenced to death—by alligator, if necessary. Maximum Bob is a delightfully dark classic thriller from “the greatest crime writer of our time, perhaps ever” (New York Times Book Review), and any reader who loved getting gleefully lost in criminal mayhem of Get Shorty, Rum Punch, Out of Sight, The Hot Kid, or any number of the inimitable Leonard’s numerous crime fiction masterworks will get maximum enjoyment out of this one.",['Elmore Leonard'],Harper Collins,2009,['Fiction'],11.0,2.0,2011-01-23,Better have a good story before you start taking liberties...,"Elmore Leonard proves in Maximum Bob that style alone can't carry a novel. Mr. Leonard should leave these things to the likes of Cormac McCarthy and truly great writers. I'll admit that this was the first walk with Leonard I've taken and it won't be my last, but for an author to have written as many novels as Leonard has you would think story mattered a bit more. In Maximum Bob, Leonard relies too heavily on thin characters that are put into a bare bones story. I will give a cheer to the dark humor that pervades (although it could have run a bit darker for my tastes) throughout, but still the thin story has its characters little more than walking/passing through places, page to page. Perhaps age and leveling energy levels had started catching up to Mr. Leonard about the time of this novel. Contractual obligations are what they are I suppose...obligations.",0,3

I believe I have a good sense of humor; I think Monty Python and The Holy Grail is hilarious, as well as many other British comedies. I also like Science Fiction. I wanted to like the book; the concept is hilarious and it seems like it would be something I would really enjoy. But it is not done well.

"We Were Soldiers Once...and Young: Ia Drang, The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam","New York Times Bestseller: A “powerful and epic story . . . the best account of infantry combat I have ever read” (Col. David Hackworth, author of About Face). In November 1965, some 450 men of the First Battalion, Seventh Cavalry, under the command of Lt. Col. Harold Moore, were dropped into a small clearing in the Ia Drang Valley. They were immediately surrounded by 2,000 North Vietnamese soldiers. Three days later, only two and a half miles away, a sister battalion was brutally slaughtered. Together, these actions at the landing zones X-Ray and Albany constituted one of the most savage and significant battles of the Vietnam War. They were the first major engagements between the US Army and the People’s Army of Vietnam. How these Americans persevered—sacrificing themselves for their comrades and never giving up—creates a vivid portrait of war at its most devastating and inspiring. Lt. Gen. Moore and Joseph L. Galloway—the only journalist on the ground throughout the fighting—interviewed hundreds of men who fought in the battle, including the North Vietnamese commanders. Their poignant account rises above the ordeal it chronicles to depict men facing the ultimate challenge, dealing with it in ways they would have once found unimaginable.

Only it’s not like the movies or old man Stoker’s storybook. It’s worse. Especially if you happen to be one of them. Just ask Joe Pitt. There’s a shambler on the loose. Some fool who got himself infected with a flesh-eating bacteria is lurching around, trying to munch on folks’ brains. Joe hates shamblers, but he’s still the one who has to deal with them. That’s just the kind of life he has. Except afterlife might be better word. From the Battery to the Bronx, and from river to river, Manhattan is crawling with Vampyres. Joe is one of them, and he’s not happy about it. Yeah, he gets to be stronger and faster than you, and he’s tough as nails and hard to kill. But spending his nights trying to score a pint of blood to feed the Vyrus that’s eating at him isn’t his idea of a good time. And Joe doesn’t make it any easier on himself. Going his own way, refusing to ally with the Clans that run the undead underside of Manhattan–it ain’t easy. It’s worse once he gets mixed up with the Coalition–the city’s most powerful Clan–and finds himself searching for a poor little rich girl who’s gone missing in Alphabet City. Now the Coalition and the girl’s high-society parents are breathing down his neck, anarchist Vampyres are pushing him around, and a crazy Vampyre cult is stalking him. No time to complain, though.

This is an excellent way to draw the readers in without making them feel like complete geeks for wanting to read more.Also what makes this series good is it's fun charactes. Joe is a great vampire protagonist. He's not gloomy or depressed about what he is, but he's not happy about it either. He has a kind of self-destructive nature and likes to take his anger out on not only himself but the few people he cares about. Imagine and undead Sid Vicious and you're on your way.Another thing that makes these books great is the way Huston uses realistic and gritty locations in New York giving the book another sense of realism. The characters Joe runs into (Vampire OR Human) also seem to reflect their setting making them a product of their environment then anyone's imagination. You'll find NO stereotypes here.This book (and it's excellent sequels) are the best, most unique stories about a vampire I've ever read.

Ana, then meets tempting spymaster Lucas who provokes passion from her. Ana suspects Lucas' best friend of being responsible for the spy murders, and circumstances lead them to be married to each other which complicates the case and their live.

Economics in one lesson,"With over a million copies sold, Economics in One Lesson is an essential guide to the basics of economic theory. A fundamental influence on modern libertarianism, Hazlitt defends capitalism and the free market from economic myths that persist to this day. Considered among the leading economic thinkers of the “Austrian School,” which includes Carl Menger, Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich (F.A.) Hayek, and others, Henry Hazlitt (1894-1993), was a libertarian philosopher, an economist, and a journalist. He was the founding vice-president of the Foundation for Economic Education and an early editor of The Freeman magazine, an influential libertarian publication. Hazlitt wrote Economics in One Lesson, his seminal work, in 1946. Concise and instructive, it is also deceptively prescient and far-reaching in its efforts to dissemble economic fallacies that are so prevalent they have almost become a new orthodoxy. Economic commentators across the political spectrum have credited Hazlitt with foreseeing the collapse of the global economy which occurred more than 50 years after the initial publication of Economics in One Lesson. Hazlitt’s focus on non-governmental solutions, strong — and strongly reasoned — anti-deficit position, and general emphasis on free markets, economic liberty of individuals, and the dangers of government intervention make Economics in One Lesson every bit as relevant and valuable today as it has been since publication.",['Henry Hazlitt'],Currency,2010,['Business & Economics'],18.0,5.0,2010-05-13,Should be required reading for Congress,"It's amazing that this book was written in 1946 but is so relevant today. Everything Hazlitt discusses about government spending, regulation, market interference, subsidies, deficit spending, and rampant encouragement of consumer debt relates directly to what is happening today. The book is written in a very readable, straight forward manner that anybody can understand, even a Democrat politician whose only reason for living is plundering and looting from the productive members of society and transferring the swag to the looters and the moochers (i.e. - their voters).I can't think of a better treatise on the war between the ""tax payers"" and the ""tax eaters"" than this book. Hazlitt refers often to ""The Forgotten Man"", a book by William Graham Sumner published in 1883 which went into much detail on how government policy will always favor the politically connected at the expense of the powerless. Politician A passes a law to benefit constituent B at the expense of constituent C (The Forgotten Man). Amity Shlaes recent history of FDR's ""The New Deal"" used the same title ""The Forgotten Man"" and was one of the best books of 2008.I highly recomment this book. It's concise, interesting, and the most readable economic books ever written.",7,8

He soon discovers that the victim was seeking to close the museum against the wishes of both staff and fellow trustees. Everyone, it seems, has something to gain from the crime. When it becomes clear that the killer is prepared to kill again, inspired by the real-life crimes from the murder room, Dalgliesh knows that to solve this case he has to get into the mind of a ruthless killer.

There is usually a 2-3 year wait between books but when she releases one, it is something to be excited about. &quot;The Murder Room&quot; is no exception and while it is not as lofty as some of her earlier novels, it is a taut little thriller and a delightful read. The first 100 pages are devoted to introducing the murder scene (a musuem) and a host of suspects. After the first murder occurs, it is not long before other victims start piling up! In addition to James' extraordinary attention to characterization, her descriptons of architecture, gardens, furnishings, etc. is wonderful. She truly makes the reader feel as though they are in the setting. It is obvious that James got her idea of an important plot event from a highly publcized film that came out a few years ago but no matter, the book delivers and fans should be pleased with this one.",5,5

Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience.,"“Csikszentmihalyi arrives at an insight that many of us can intuitively grasp, despite our insistent (and culturally supported) denial of this truth. That is, it is not what happens to us that determines our happiness, but the manner in which we make sense of that reality. . . . The manner in which Csikszentmihalyi integrates research on consciousness, personal psychology and spirituality is illuminating.” —Los Angeles Times Book Review The bestselling classic that holds the key to unlocking meaning, creativity, peak performance, and true happiness. Legendary psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's famous investigations of ""optimal experience"" have revealed that what makes an experience genuinely satisfying is a state of consciousness called flow. During flow, people typically experience deep enjoyment, creativity, and a total involvement with life. In this new edition of his groundbreaking classic work, Csikszentmihalyi (""the leading researcher into ‘flow states’"" —Newsweek) demonstrates the ways this positive state can be controlled, not just left to chance. Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience teaches how, by ordering the information that enters our consciousness, we can discover true happiness, unlock our potential, and greatly improve the quality of our lives.",['Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi'],Harper Collins,2009,['Psychology'],1404.0,4.0,2006-11-24,Psychology or Philosophy ?,"This is a curious but engaging book. Despite the use of the word 'psychology' on the cover, I would rate it 1/3 psychology, 2/3 philosophy, anthropology, and sociology. The author's psychological contribution is based on a series of self-reporting tests where subjects were beeped at random moments and asked to record their moods and thoughts. Lord knows what happened if the beep came during a sensitive business meeting or while making love, the author does not say. He should have. Little also is made of the tendency of anyone to respond in accordance with what they feel will be expected of them or will be well received. This factor and how it was treated should have been debated. When all that is said and done however, there is an honest and provocative account of what makes for the happiest experiences of (mostly) (western, industrialised, modern) people. You could also reframe it as an account of how these same (mostly) (western, modern, indistrialised) people arrive at the state of concentrated and unified attention which throughout the ages has been recognised as the path to paradise. The author gives in fact fair attention to the Oriental paths to the same result, although he stops short of recognising that the Oriental formulation of the result is meaningful. The author's knowledge of the philosophical tradition is deep, and his references to it are always refreshing. A thoroughly interesting read, to be balanced with any modern work on neuro-psychiatry for a satisfying synthesis.",11,15

Everyone is assigned work at the age of twelve and Jonas is no different. But his work assignment certainly is. He's been selected to take on the most honored - and the most painful - assignment in the community. It is a work that no one else can do, except for the man who was selected for the work before Jonas - The Giver. He trains Jonas and prepares him to really understand and acquire the wisdom that comes from the work. Not only does Jonas remain brave and courageous throughout his training, but he goes beyond that and thinks of a way to try and save his community even if it thinks it doesn't need saving.Jonas' community has been developed into an isolated community devoid of free will and the people have been trained from infancy to accept it and to know no other way of life. Every December there is a ceremony held for each age group ages 1-12. Everyone in a given age group is given the same thing. For all the new children born that year they are assigned names; the eights are all given the same style jackets to signify their age group; the nines receive their bicycles; the tens have their hair cut in a particular style; the twelves are assigned their work. Everyone knows their place and the rules. Adults apply to be married and The Elders assign the partners. Those parents apply for children. They are allowed only one boy and one girl and those children are assigned to their parents during the ceremony where they are named. Dreams are scheduled for discussion in each family unit as a matter of course every morning. Feelings of the day are discussed at dinner. But soon Jonas learns that everything doesn't have to be this way.How would our real world change if everything was assigned and regulated? If no one was allowed free will, would we all be safer? What if we didn't know about free will - would our communities and societies be better? How long do you think a world like Jonas' would last?The Giver is a very popular book for children to read in schools and for good reason.

We sometimes confuse power, wealth and fame with true achievement. We can do great things, and occasionally terrible things, to reassure ourselves that we matter to the world. We need to think of ourselves as good people and are troubled when we compromise our integrity to be successful and important. In Living a Life That Matters, Rabbi Kushner suggests that the path to a truly successful and significant life lies in friendship, family, acts of generosity and self-sacrifice, as well as in God's forgiving nature.

It is a 1960's academia entrenched in a Western cannon, believing itself capable of interpreting the cultural relevance of myth to non-Western peoples through the same lens it uses to critique western, and specifically Biblical, myth. Repeated references to &quot;primitive cultures,&quot; a complete dismissal of African myth tradition, and a clear implication of a Western superiority make the insightful commentary on myth a challenge to isolate.If you are really interested in comparative study of myth, look at some original texts and avoid internalizing Campbell's bias; Campbell schematically interprets the Indian Vedas, Zen texts, Navajo stories, Norse mythology, the Bible, and works by Dante, Jung and Freud.A discussion on the mythical implications of &quot;last year's&quot; moonwalk, or the Kennedy assassination, for instance, don't help much.",15,41

Out of America: A Black Man Confronts Africa,"Nothing in Keith Richburg's long and respected journalistic career at the Washington Post prepared him for what he would encounter as the paper's correspondent in Africa. He found a continent where brutal murder had become routine, where dictators and warlords silenced dissent with machine guns and machetes, and where starvation had become depressingly common. With a great deal of personal anguish, Richburg faced a difficult question: If this is Africa, what does it mean to be an African American? In this provocative and unvarnished account of his three years on the continent of his ancestors, Richburg takes us on a extraordinary journey that sweeps from Somalia to South Africa, showing how he confronted the divide between his African racial heritage and his American cultural identity.",['Keith B. Richburg'],Basic Books,2009,['Biography & Autobiography'],6.0,2.0,1998-12-27,"Interesting, but more about America than Africa","Richburg's book attacks the myths of Afrocentrists in the United States, a very easy target. Richburg succeeds, hence the often admiring reviews, but there is little here new about Africa. The key failing is that Richburg is so keen to knock down Afro-centrist myths that he creates an Americano-centric myth. He treats Africa as a whole in the same mistaken way that the Afro-centrists do. Richburg's thought as he saw the bodies of slaughtered Rwandans in the river that &quot;there but for the grace of God go I&quot; sounds good but is actually vapid. The idea is that but for the enforced journey to America through slavery that he too might have been a slaughtered Rwandan. In fact, few if any slaves came to America from Rwanda, a country which is rather a long way away and very different from the west African regions from which slaves were bought. The point is that Africa is as diverse as Europe or Asia, something which neither Richburg nor his Afro-centrist opponents seem to understand. It is as if Irish American journalists went to Bosnia and declared that had it not been for the potato famine which drove their ancestors to leave for the USA, then they too would have ended up being butchered by the Serbs at Srebrenica. A book then for those interested in the debates about Africa between Americans rather than for those interested in finding out about what is actually happening in a large, diverse and interesting continent.",8,17

1st to Die: A Novel,"Four crime-solving friends face off against a killer in San Francisco in the Women's Murder Club novel that started James Patterson's thrilling series. Each one holds a piece of the puzzle: Lindsay Boxer is a homicide inspector in the San Francisco Police Department, Claire Washburn is a medical examiner, Jill Bernhardt is an assistant D.A., and Cindy Thomas just started working the crime desk of the San Francisco Chronicle. But the usual procedures aren't bringing them any closer to stopping the killings. So these women form a Women's Murder Club to collaborate outside the box and pursue the case by sidestepping their bosses and giving each other a hand. The four women develop intense bonds as they pursue a killer whose crimes have stunned an entire city. Working together, they track down the most terrifying and unexpected killer they have ever encountered--before a shocking conclusion in which everything they knew turns out to be devastatingly wrong. Full of the breathtaking drama and unforgettable emotions for which James Patterson is famous, 1st to Die is the start of the #1 New York Times bestselling series of crime thrillers.",['James Patterson'],Hachette UK,2001,['Fiction'],3570.0,4.0,2005-02-25,Interesting and a lot of fun,Lindsay Boxer is a very likeable character because of her professional integrity and her personal fight with an illness she can't control. I could relate to her struggles because I am also a woman with an active career (school psychologist) and a serious illness(congestive heart failure). I understand Lindsay's fight to maintain her personal life and professional life while undergoing medical treatments. Patterson created a story that made me care about the mystery as well as the characters' personal lives. There are many twists in the ending that kept me guessing. I listened to this book on CD and thoroughly enjoyed it.,0,0

The Great Divorce,"What if anyone in Hell could take a bus trip to Heaven and stay there forever if they wanted to? In The Great Divorce C. S. Lewis again employs his formidable talent for fable and allegory. The writer finds himself in Hell boarding a bus bound for Heaven. The amazing opportunity is that anyone who wants to stay in Heaven, can. This is the starting point for an extraordinary meditation upon good and evil, grace and judgment. Lewis's revolutionary idea is the discovery that the gates of Hell are locked from the inside. In Lewis's own words, ""If we insist on keeping Hell (or even earth) we shall not see Heaven: if we accept Heaven we shall not be able to retain even the smallest and most intimate souvenirs of Hell.""",['C. S. Lewis'],Harper Collins,2009,['Religion'],21.0,5.0,2006-01-02,From Gray to Dawn,"A gray man, in a gray city waits with other gray people for a gray bus. This is the opening of C.S. Lewis' THE GREAT DIVORCE, Lewis' allegory on Heaven and Hell. This isn't the Hell of Dante or Revelations, filled with fire and brimstone; this is a Hell that is the complete and total absence of God. This is a Hell that is of one's own making, the only options are to totally embrace God's love or continue to hold on to those earthly wants and desires that we all possess and remain trapped. According to Lewis, these choices are mutually exclusive; this is not a ""cafeteria"" relationship where one can pick and choose.Arriving at a place midway between Heaven and Hell the travelers meet various guides that have come to help move them closer to God and Heaven. Lewis creates a series of dialogues between the travelers and guides to address the questions many have regarding earthly matters and be shown how utterly insignificant they are. Choices are then made to continue to move towards God or turn back to the grayness.In his other works, Lewis has explored this vision of God, a God who is not indifferent to us but One that expects, at the very least, we make the effort to accept Him and receive the fulfillment that can only be found in His embrace. THE GREAT DIVORCE is a fine work; easily read and very clear in its presentation; this is a book to be read by any age that's ready to explore the relationship of God and man, Heaven and Hell.",11,11

The Human Factor,"Maurice Castle is a high-level operative in the British secret service during the Cold War. He is deeply in love with his African wife, who escaped apartheid South Africa with the help of his communist friend. Despite his misgivings, Castle decides to act as a double agent, passing information to the Soviets to help his in-laws in South Africa. In order to evade detection, he allows his assistant to be wrongly identified as the source of the leaks. But when suspicions remain, Castle is forced to make an even more excruciating sacrifice to save himself. Originally published in 1978, The Human Factor is an exciting novel of espionage drawn from Greene’s own experiences in MI6 during World War II, and ultimately a deeply humanistic examination of the very nature of loyalty. This edition features a new introduction by Colm Tóibín. For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date translations by award-winning translators.",['Graham Greene'],Penguin,2008,['Fiction'],13.0,4.0,2002-08-21,"""I sent...the book to Moscow, to my friend Kim Philby...""","Publishing this novel in 1978, Greene says in his autobiography (Ways of Escape, pp. 256 - 257) that he had actually started it ten years earlier, abandoning it when his friend and former colleague, Kim Philby, defected to Russia. He did not want this book to be considered a roman a clef. Like Philby, Maurice Castle, the main character in this novel, is a double agent, and Greene goes to great pains to bring him to life and try to make his inevitable defection to Russia believable. Having earlier lived in South Africa, Castle had fallen in love with Sarah, an African woman. Another double agent had helped her escape from South Africa so she and Castle could be married. Now living in England with Sarah and their son, Castle continues to provide information to the Russians as payback for the help he received years before.The cloak-and-dagger intrigue here is rooted in the Cold War, and Greene's own sympathies with the Communists, well known, are noticeable throughout the novel. When a leak is suspected in Castle's section of British intelligence, a secret plan is devised to eliminate the culprit quietly to avoid another Philby-type embarrassment to the government. It's of only minor consequence to the higher-ups that they kill Davis, an innocent man. The Russians' rush to ""save"" Castle, whose work for them has really been of only minor importance, seems more like wishful thinking than reality. Codes created from duplicate copies of old books, messages left in a hollow tree, and warning signals made with rings of the telephone now seem to belong to an age much earlier than the mere 24 years which have evolved since the book's publication.Castle is well drawn, for the most part, though he seems a rather clumsy agent-about-to-defect, someone who, though supposedly devoted to his wife and child, has not thought far enough ahead to guarantee their ultimate safety and happiness. Sarah, unfortunately, is an undifferentiated, flat character, and Castle's devotion to her must be accepted, rather than felt, thereby limiting the impact of the ending. Parts of the book are very moving, and Castle is often a sympathetic character, but I thought the book lacked the philosophical and structural tightness of his earlier, more famous novels.

Operating Systems: Internals and Design Principles (5th Edition) (GOAL Series),"For a one-semester undergraduate course in operating systems for computer science, computer engineering, and electrical engineering majors. Winner of the 2009 Textbook Excellence Award from the Text and Academic Authors Association (TAA)! Operating Systems: Internals and Design Principles is a comprehensive and unified introduction to operating systems. By using several innovative tools, Stallings makes it possible to understand critical core concepts that can be fundamentally challenging. The new edition includes the implementation of web based animations to aid visual learners. At key points in the book, students are directed to view an animation and then are provided with assignments to alter the animation input and analyze the results. The concepts are then enhanced and supported by end-of-chapter case studies of UNIX, Linux and Windows Vista. These provide students with a solid understanding of the key mechanisms of modern operating systems and the types of design tradeoffs and decisions involved in OS design. Because they are embedded into the text as end of chapter material, students are able to apply them right at the point of discussion. This approach is equally useful as a basic reference and as an up-to-date survey of the state of the art.",['William Stallings'],Prentice Hall,2009,['Computers'],11.0,4.0,2011-12-20,Contrarian opinion,"I happened across this book in the library.Call me an idiot.

This new book on parenting will round out the relationship mega-brand that John has created. Focusing on children ages 1-9, John explains that this is the period of dependence in a child's life when character and sense of self are shaped. Parents everywhere are sure to breathe a sigh of relief that they now have a John Gray book they can turn to help children reach their fullest potential.",['John Gray'],Harper Collins,2009,['Family & Relationships'],4.0,3.0,2012-11-08,Children are from Heaven... as long as you keep bribing them...,"The main idea in this book is that in order to get your kids ""to cooperate"" you should offer them rewards and then, together with some positive thinking that aims to increase their self esteem but sounds a bit unrealistic (""it's ok to say no, but Mum is boss"", ""it's ok to want more"", ""it's ok to make mistakes"", etc (??)) they will behave because they want to not because you make them. Right, please, tell me that if your kid is really rude to you or your relatives you are going to say ""it's ok to call your grandmother a fat-ass, it was a mistake, I can see how upset and tired you are from all this lovely kicking that I am getting on my shins... there, there, promise you will apologize and never do it again and say that Mum is boss and I will give you your favourite candy"". Right?I liked many of the things I found in this book, though, and agreed with a lot of what the author says. The chapter about different types of children according to their personalities and how to best handle them (not with bribes this time) is very useful and interesting. Also, the positive ideas and attitudes towards children do make you think and try to understand your kids better, which is what you aim for, really, when you read books about good parenting. But when I was told that in order to stop my child from causing a scene in a public place ""where I cannot use the skills learned from the author"", I should always carry my child's favourite candy to hand it to her in these situations so that she will cooperate, I lost it. I was reading in my kindle, otherwise the book would have flown, I was so angry. I imagined myself all sweet and smiley, eyes twitching madly, after trying these techniques for a few months...""Oh, my, are you upset because we are shopping? here is a little candy so that you can keep behaving like a little s*it... it is a reward for terrorizing the cashiers every time we come to the supermarket, darling. I am going to avoid confronting you and your tantrums because I am so embarra...., ahem, letting you get in touch with your inner feelings while I think about ways to kill myself before you turn 12 and do it for me anyway"". And then the author says that if the child is misbehaving like that you are propably placating them too much at home. Seriously??? And how about motivating your teenagers to behave better and study harder using money as a reward? excuse me? what about the people who simply can't offer their kids more money or shopping trips to the mall because they can't afford it? you can call it what you like but to me this is pure bribing. And spoiling. The author says it always works, and I must admit it probably does, but after a while (talking from experience here) you will find that the rewards will have to get bigger and bigger in order to keep motivating your kids.Also... using candy and other types of unhealthy foods will create kids that as grown-ups will seek confort in food. In bad food. I don't think it takes a shrink to see that.So, a bit of a let down, but not bad. Like I said, there is good stuff in there. But also a lot of... yeah, that's right.",0,0

Angel of Darkness: The True Story of Randy Kraft and the Most Heinous Murder Spree,"Randy Kraft was highly intelligent, politically active, loyal to his friends, committed to his work--and the killer of 67 people--more than any other serial killer known. This book offers a glimpse into the dark mind of a living monster. ""To open this book is to open a peephole into hell"".--Associated Press. Photographs.",['Dennis McDougal'],Grand Central Publishing,2009,['True Crime'],3.0,5.0,2013-01-08,How this killer is little known is beyond me,"As good as this book is and as many people as Randy Kraft killed in as populated as a place as Southern California... it begs the question: How come Randy Kraft is not well known? I did see a couple of the theories by some of Oregon's law enforcement agents and I happen to agree with them. Many of the victims were gay men as was the killer and the victims, being men, were not considered as vulnerable as women are; hence if you ended up dead then it was partly your fault.Leaving that aside, the book was a very good read. It wasn't bogged down with just times and dates and it is apparent that Dennis McDougal did considerable research. Granted, this is probably the goriest and most descriptive true crime book I've read, but it is all necessary in conveying the brutality of the crimes. At times the book was more biographical about Randy Kraft than it was an account of the crimes itself and the pursuit of the criminal, but that helped give a view of what the killer was like.This book was also heavily laden with references to other killers. Dennis brought up the likes of Charles Manson, Ted Bundy, John Wayne Gacy and even lesser known killers such as Dean Corll, Juan Corona and Bluebeard. But one of the more interesting threads in this book was the mention of Patrick Kearney (the Trash Bag Killer) and William Bonin (the mistaken Freeway Killer). These to eerily similar serial killers were operating at the same time as Kraft and in the same locale!! So it was almost a bonus to read about their crimes and perversions so as to get an even more complete picture of the atmosphere in Southern California at that time.Ultimately, I liked McDougal's style and his delivery. This is a worthwhile book for true crime fans who would like to know about the most prolific serial killer in American History.",1,1

But his contentment is disturbed when the wizard Gandalf and a company of dwarves arrive on his doorstep one day to whisk him away on an adventure. They have launched a plot to raid the treasure hoard guarded by Smaug the Magnificent, a large and very dangerous dragon. Bilbo reluctantly joins their quest, unaware that on his journey to the Lonely Mountain he will encounter both a magic ring and a frightening creature known as Gollum. Written for J.R.R.

WITHOUT REMORSE is a tale of much smaller scale about one man's quest for revenge. Another beautiful addition to this book is how it begins. Most of Clancy's books don't become truly interesting to me until about the 150-250 page range. This book captured my imagination from the very first sentence and never let go.

Plain Jane: A Novel of Jane Seymour (Tudor Women Series),"When she is granted a position at court as maid of honor to Queen Catherine, Henry VIII's aging wife, plain but brilliant Jane Seymour catches Henry's wandering eye and concocts a clever scheme to win both his heart and the crown. Reprint.",['Laurien Gardner'],Penguin,2008,['Fiction'],1.0,2.0,2011-05-08,Fascinating queen; mediocre writing at best,"Truth to tell, I've always been rather intrigued by Jane Seymour as a historical figure. If more was known about her-- and if she'd lived longer-- she'd probably have just as many pages devoted to her as Anne Boleyn has garnered over the years. No matter how meek and mild she may have seemed, she had the courage and spunk to stand up to Henry VIII over his destruction of the monasteries and harsh quashing of the Northern Rebellion, knowing how the previous queen had been treated for ""too much meddling in his affairs.""However, this book was downright painful to read. Why? Well, it did provide some information about Jane's life, her tenure at court, her romance with Henry, and her brief life as queen. I actually didn't have a problem with the repeated references to Jane's plainness. The surviving Holbein portrait shows a woman whose face had great character but who was not physically attractive at all, and we have to remember that these portraits were designed to flatter the sitter, so she likely looked even less attractive than that. She came from fairly minor landed gentry, and without much of a dowry, a woman as unattractive as she was probably would have had problems getting well married. Those were the unpleasant facts, and her family probably was not silent about them.No, the real problem-- and I'm sorry to say this-- is tha the writing is so very bad. Whoever this particular author actually is, she does not seem to have learned the most cardinal rule-- ""show, don't tell."" We get paragraph after paragraph of dull expostions and internal monologues in place of the action and dialogue that we should have. Transitions are grating; scenes are dull and lifeless. The scene on pg. 166 is a perfect example. Anne, her ladies, and Thomas Wyatt are teasing Jane about a mysterious package she received from the king the day before.Anne suggests that it was an herbal remedy. Everyone laughs. This was tedious enough, but then we get this:""Of course, the thought of the king's mixing herbal remedies, much less favoring the queen's ladies with them, was funny, since this was the work of women, and the king was, if anything, too masculine a man to consider any such remedies, much less to make them.""Argh!! This is like the first draft produced by a freshman English creative writing class. How could any competent editor let this get through? In fact, there are times when it's hard to say if the fault lies more with the author or with the editor, who apparently went on vacation that week and just couldn't be bothered to get a replacement. *Everything* reads like a first draft; the book would be greatly improved by simply cutting out paragraphs right and left (but then you'd basically have a short story.)All in all, Jane was an intriguing character, and while there really isn't enough material about her life to make up much of a biography, there's more than enough for fictional novels. Let's see more of them instead of the never-ending mining of Anne Boleyn-- she has truly been done to death.",2,2
Cat's Cradle,"“A free-wheeling vehicle . . . an unforgettable ride!”—The New York Times Cat’s Cradle is Kurt Vonnegut’s satirical commentary on modern man and his madness. An apocalyptic tale of this planet’s ultimate fate, it features a midget as the protagonist, a complete, original theology created by a calypso singer, and a vision of the future that is at once blackly fatalistic and hilariously funny.

Slaughter-House Five (First paperback edition),"A special fiftieth anniversary edition of Kurt Vonnegut’s masterpiece, “a desperate, painfully honest attempt to confront the monstrous crimes of the twentieth century” (Time), featuring a new introduction by Kevin Powers, author of the National Book Award finalist The Yellow Birds Selected by the Modern Library as one of the 100 best novels of all time Slaughterhouse-Five, an American classic, is one of the world’s great antiwar books. Centering on the infamous World War II firebombing of Dresden, the novel is the result of what Kurt Vonnegut described as a twenty-three-year struggle to write a book about what he had witnessed as an American prisoner of war. It combines historical fiction, science fiction, autobiography, and satire in an account of the life of Billy Pilgrim, a barber’s son turned draftee turned optometrist turned alien abductee. As Vonnegut had, Billy experiences the destruction of Dresden as a POW. Unlike Vonnegut, he experiences time travel, or coming “unstuck in time.” An instant bestseller, Slaughterhouse-Five made Kurt Vonnegut a cult hero in American literature, a reputation that only strengthened over time, despite his being banned and censored by some libraries and schools for content and language. But it was precisely those elements of Vonnegut’s writing—the political edginess, the genre-bending inventiveness, the frank violence, the transgressive wit—that have inspired generations of readers not just to look differently at the world around them but to find the confidence to say something about it. Authors as wide-ranging as Norman Mailer, John Irving, Michael Crichton, Tim O’Brien, Margaret Atwood, Elizabeth Strout, David Sedaris, Jennifer Egan, and J. K. Rowling have all found inspiration in Vonnegut’s words. Jonathan Safran Foer has described Vonnegut as “the kind of writer who made people—young people especially—want to write.” George Saunders has declared Vonnegut to be “the great, urgent, passionate American writer of our century, who offers us . . . a model of the kind of compassionate thinking that might yet save us from ourselves.” Fifty years after its initial publication at the height of the Vietnam War, Vonnegut's portrayal of political disillusionment, PTSD, and postwar anxiety feels as relevant, darkly humorous, and profoundly affecting as ever, an enduring beacon through our own era’s uncertainties. “Poignant and hilarious, threaded with compassion and, behind everything, the cataract of a thundering moral statement.”—The Boston Globe",['Kurt Vonnegut'],Dial Press Trade Paperback,1999,['Fiction'],1523.0,4.0,2009-09-21,Classy Science Fiction with WW II Destruction of Dresden,"Slaughterhouse-Five is a deep book that can be read on many levels. On the surface, it's a science fiction tale that deals with a man, Billy Pilgrim, who was purportedly abducted by aliens and can become ""unstuck"" in time, and can move back and forth between and re-experience moments of his life at any point between his birth and death. A signficant part of the book deals with the Billy's experiences in World War II and being present when the German city of Dresden was destroyed by Allied bombing in February 1945. However, this tale is at least in small part, autobiographical, as the books writer, Kurt Vonnegut, served in World War II and many of the decriptions given in the book are clearly derived from Mr Vonnegut's experiences. It was largely to read about these experiences that I bought and read Slaughterhouse-Five.Many books have been written about the destruction of Dresden, but Mr Vonnegut's point of view ... that of an American POW being held in Dresden ... is fairly unique. Even if fiction, at various points in the narrative, Mr Vonnegut apparently speaks directly to the reader, to say that he was the person that such and such event occurred to. The book is written in a darkly humorous style, and the books shifts from present to past to future quite often, as befitting the experiences of someone who has become unstuck in time.I enjoyed the book as entertainment, and felt that it also added to my understanding of what happened at Dresden in World War II. My only quibble with the book is that the ending seems a bit flat to me, although given that the book is an anti-war science fiction novel, it may not be entirely out of place.",0,0
Across the High Lonesome,"Considine and Pete Runyon had once been friends, back in the days when both were cowhands. But when Runyon married the woman Considine loved, the two parted ways. Runyon settled down and became a sheriff. Considine took up robbing banks. Now Considine is planning a raid on the bank at Obaro, a plan that will pit him against Runyon . . . and lead to riches or suicide. The one thing he never counted on was meeting a strong, beautiful woman and her stubborn father, hell-bent on traveling alone through Apache territory to a new life. Suddenly Considine must choose between revenge and redemption—and either choice could be the last one he makes.","[""Louis L'Amour""]",Bantam,2005,['Fiction'],7.0,5.0,2006-03-25,A great story with terrific characters and vivid word pictures,"While James Brumfield's ""Across the High Lonesome"" is a vastly different book than his outstanding first novel, ""A Tourist in the Yucatan"", it is nonetheless just as excellent. Fans of the first novel will find this book is written with an emphasis on great characterization, beautiful descriptions of nature, and wonderful storytelling.Writing from his background as a ""packer"" in the Sierras, Brumfield admittedly draws from his own personal experiences in "".... Lonesome"". The novel describes a summer in the life of Molly Mendoza, a wet-behind-the-ears college graduate who just found her fiance' in bed with her best friend. Molly decides to run away, from not only that experience, but from her predictable life as well and join up with a tourist service in the California Sierra Mountains. Along the way, Molly meets and becomes romantically involved with two of the wilderness guides, Don Davidson and Dwight Broussard. The adventures that Molly finds along the trail change her completely as she finds out more about herself than she ever dreamed. And, while the book is dominated by these three main actors, there are plenty of other memorable and unique characters along the way.Matching just the right amount of nature with story, Brumfield does a masterful job getting the reader to relate to the different characters. The reader will hit the ground running as Molly's story takes off practically from page one. Brumfield does not inundate the reader with page after page of word pictures describing this beautiful part of Northern California. He uses those descriptions effectively in moderation (especially in the last 2/3rds of the book) and doesn't ""fluff"" his writing. While, not necessarily an action-driven plot, Brumfield has created a book that is just good, basic storytelling at its best. Readers will easily relate to the many different characters portrayed in the book. There's plenty of both ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"" to go around. Plus, there's just enough suspense mixed with a modicum of violence to please a variety of readers.As mentioned earlier, by Brumfield's own admission ""...Lonesome"" is as much HIS story as a packer and wilderness guide as it is fiction. He writes from the heart and that passion for this way of life comes forward in his work. This is definitely a strength of his as a writer and was evident in his debut novel, ""A Tourist in the Yucatan"". (HIGHLY recommended, by the way) If you are a fan of Larry McMurtry, A.B. Guthie, or even the frontier heroine novels of Willa Cather, you won't be disappointed with ""Across the High Lonesome"". It is a solid effort from a very promising writer. Here's hoping that Brumfield will become even more prolific and continue to create more great stories like this one!",26,37

No verily's, thou's, lo's, wherefore's, hark's, or shalt's... no none of such language was in vogue. Say when was that language in style, and by whom? Oh yes, that's right, by John Q. Public in the middle ages. Say when was the King James bible translated? Oh yes, that same time. I wonder why they used verily's, thou's, wilt's, wherefore's, hark's, and hitherto's. Oh yes because the goal was to make the Bible assessable to the public. Translated from it's Greek, and Hebrew, and Latin texts into the English Parlance of the day. But the book of mormon wisely realized of course in 1830 we don't speak that way, so why was it written that way?Say that book is pretty thick, I wonder how many golden plates it took to hold the entire volume.

Breaking Apart : A Memoir of Divorce,"Now in paperback, this ""courageous story, beautifully told"" [Washington Post] offers a searing examination of a marriage coming apart piece by piece. ""There are those who believe it is simple selfishness that leads people to divorce. For those of us who have lived it, it's hard to see why anyone would rip out their veins for some immature or narcissistic desire to get what they want, because that is what it feels like."" --from Breaking Apart Piercingly honest and profoundly moving, Wendy Swallow's memoir traces the arc of her marriage and its painful disintegration.

Ms. Swallow's flimsy approach to autobiography reflects her obvious call for the reader's commiseration, and her tone at times dangerously obscures the line between the legitimate and the pathetic. The topic of divorce is a highly energizing issue for today's society in which the marital split is so prevalent, but Ms. Swallow's work fails to capitalize on the great potential that is present in such an engaging and relevant contemporary discourse.",8,17

The Letters of Kingsley Amis,"Throughout his life, Sir Kingsley Amis was a prolific, and outrageous correspondent. In his letters to friends such as Philip Larkin and Robert Conquest he was able to unbutton himself to an extent impossible in work intended for publication, and as a result the more than 700 letters contained in this volume contain some of his wittiest and most acerbic writings.",['Kingsley Amis'],HarperCollins,2000,"['Novelists, English']",1.0,4.0,2004-01-31,"Amusing, interesting, often catty, revealing","Kingsley Amis is one of my favorite post-war novelists. I had not before read a collection of letters, and I confess there was a time when I would have thought the idea of actually reading through someone's lifetime of letters just plain idiotic. But in fact I found these fascinating -- interesting to read for the biographical details, hints of the creative process, discussion of his works and Philip Larkin's works in progress -- as well as often very very funny and sometimes eyebrow-raisingly nasty.Zachary Leader has chosen about 800 of several thousand surviving letters. The great bulk are to the poet Philip Larkin, his closest friend. Another huge chunk are to another very close friend, the writer and Sovietologist Robert Conquest. He also corresponded a good deal with my favorite novelist, Anthony Powell, another good friend of his (though Amis betrays a certain lack of confidence in his friendship with AP -- I sense that he was intimidated by Powell's upper class background and lifestyle, by his rather mandarin literary taste, and by his age). There are many letters to his second wife, Elizabeth Jane Howard, as well as a rather unfortunate set of nasty comments about her in other letters after their rather ugly divorce. Lots of letters to agents and publishers -- these rather interesting from the writing business point of view. Quite a few responses to fan letters -- these generally quite gracious and often offering interesting answers to questions about Amis' books. Unfortunately no letters to Bruce Montgomery (&quot;Edmund Crispin&quot;), another of Amis' special friends: they cannot be inspected until 2035! Hilly Bardwell Amis Boyd, Lady Kilmarnock, his first wife, burned all his letters, perhaps understandably, after he left her (or she left him but because of his affair with Howard) in 1963. Amis in his life was reluctant have any of his other letters to women lovers printed, and Leader either didn't track down any such, or chose not to print them. As for his children, Philip did not keep his letters, Sally did not want them published, and Martin could find only a postcard or two (though apparently there were many more).Highlights? His early letters to Larkin, with their complexabbreviations and injokes, and the talk about poetry. The cattiness he displays towards writers whose work he disliked, such as most obviously John Wain, his fellow &quot;Angry Young Man&quot;. Amis on &quot;Old English Literature&quot;: &quot;The prose is admitted even by initiates to be stumbling and graceless; the verse is shackled by continual repetitions of idea ... This is the echo of an Age stated but not shown to be Heroic whose literature carries neither primitive insight nor civilized assurance.&quot; (and more) The general funniness of things, even though occasionally mean.Certainly an amusing and interesting angle from which to consider a great writer.",6,6

Girl in Hyacinth Blue,"This New York Times bestseller explores the life and many owners of an imaginary Vermeer painting in an “impressive debut collection” of linked stories (Publishers Weekly). A Dutch painting of a young girl survives three and a half centuries of loss, flood, anonymity, theft, secrecy, and even the Holocaust. This is the story of its owners whose lives are influenced by its beauty and mystery. Despite their many troubles and unsatisfied longings, the girl in hyacinth blue has the power to inspire love in all its human variety. This luminous story begins in the present day, when a professor invites a colleague to his home to see a painting that he has kept secret for decades. The professor swears it is a Vermeer—but why has he hidden this important work for so long? The reasons unfold in a series of events that trace the ownership of the painting back to World War II and Amsterdam, and still further back to the moment of the work’s inspiration. As the painting moves through each owner’s hands, what was long hidden quietly surfaces, illuminating poignant moments in multiple lives.

The story unfolds on a classic Krantz background, a magic carpet of gorgeous entertainment and sumptuous events. Yet, at its core, The Jewels of Tessa Kent is an engrossing, deeply moving, and ultimately inspiring tale of two women bound by blood yet torn apart by their deepest emotions. Tessa Kent, an exquisite and precocious fourteen, gives birth to an illegitimate daughter. Her parents, devout Catholics, raise the infant, Maggie, as their own child. At sixteen Tessa is discovered by Hollywood; by nineteen she's an international movie star. Maggie lives for her glorious ""sister's"" infrequent whirlwind visits. Maggie is a captivating, independent eighteen when she accidentally learns the truth. Mortally wounded, she breaks all ties with Tessa and starts to work at the famed Manhattan auction house of Scott & Scott. Five years later, a life-altering crisis makes Tessa passionately determined to end this estrangement. An auction is the only way she can find to reach her daughter, an auction of the immensely valuable collection of famed jewels that represent all the love lavished on her by her late husband. Tessa promises Scott & Scott the auction on the condition that Maggie and she work closely together on the sale. For Tessa, her entire future now hangs on the hope of an almost impossible reconciliation.

Is your investment in that new Internet stock a sign of stock market savvy or an act of peculiarly American speculative folly? How has the psychology of investing changed—and not changed—over the last five hundred years? In Devil Take the Hindmost, Edward Chancellor traces the origins of the speculative spirit back to ancient Rome and chronicles its revival in the modern world: from the tulip scandal of 1630s Holland, to “stockjobbing” in London's Exchange Alley, to the infamous South Sea Bubble of 1720, which prompted Sir Isaac Newton to comment, “I can calculate the motion of heavenly bodies, but not the madness of people.” Here are brokers underwriting risks that included highway robbery and the “assurance of female chastity”; credit notes and lottery tickets circulating as money; wise and unwise investors from Alexander Pope and Benjamin Disraeli to Ivan Boesky and Hillary Rodham Clinton. From the Gilded Age to the Roaring Twenties, from the nineteenth century railway mania to the crash of 1929, from junk bonds and the Japanese bubble economy to the day-traders of the Information Era, Devil Take the Hindmost tells a fascinating story of human dreams and folly through the ages.",['Edward Chancellor'],Penguin,2000,['Business & Economics'],2.0,4.0,2012-07-10,Exactly what it says it is,"I read this book for a Finance book club.

In the Bible, her life is only hinted at in a brief and violent detour within the more familiar chapters of the Book of Genesis that are about her father, Jacob, and his dozen sons. Told in Dinah's voice, this novel reveals the traditions and turmoils of ancient womanhood--the world of the red tent. It begins with the story of her mothers--Leah, Rachel, Zilpah, and Bilhah--the four wives of Jacob. They love Dinah and give her gifts that sustain her through a hard-working youth, a calling to midwifery, and a new home in a foreign land. Dinah's story reaches out from a remarkable period of early history and creates an intimate connection with the past. Deeply affecting, The Red Tent combines rich storytelling with a valuable achievement in modern fiction: a new view of biblical women's society.",['Anita Diamant'],Picador,1998,['Fiction'],3653.0,1.0,2001-08-16,Irresponsible,"I was excited to read THE RED TENT because I had heard such wonderful things about it. However, as I read, I grew increasingly disappointed by the callousness of the author in regards to the Word of God. I acknowledge that this is a piece of fiction. My question for the author is, if you intended to write a piece of fiction based on an actual person, why did you not accurately use the facts on hand and build your story upon the truth? Why would you base your story on a real person and then change almost everything that you knew to be true about that person and the other related characters? It just doesn't make sense. Diamant weaves just enough truth into her work that readers with little knowledge of the Bible believe that her events may actually be possible. From the lineage graph in the beginning to Dinah's encounter with the prince, Diamant has taken liberty wtih the truth and changed it for a purpose that perplexes me. Just from a literary point of view, having that may errors proved a distration for me. I was so caught up in blatant errors that I couldn't fully enjoy the excellent descriptive passages. From a biblical stand point, her lack of regard for the truth was disturbing. The Holy Bible is the most dynamic piece of literature in human interest. It doesn't need to be ""jazzed"" up. Her novel would have rated 5 stars if she had made the entire piece fictional and had not ""based"" it on a actual person....",4,11
Happy Housewives,"Says former desperate housewife Darla Shine to stay-at-home moms everywhere: What have you got to complain about? A modern-day guide to keeping house, raising kids, and loving life. Darla Shine was once a desperate housewife. Being at home with two small children and a husband who was rarely home was enough to drive her crazy. She left her high-profile job as a television producer after her son was born, while her husband continued to move up the corporate ladder. Like many of her stay-at-home-mom friends, Shine employed a housekeeper and baby-sitters so she could spend her time running to the salon, the club, and out to lunch. Then one day she was whining to her mother about how terrible her life was, and her mother yelled at her to wake up and stop being so selfish. It was just the wakeup call she needed! The desperate housewife craze of today is sending the wrong message to women and their children everywhere, says Shine. When did being a good mom and being proud to stay home with the kids go out of style? When did it become acceptable to cheat on your husband? When did mothers start dressing like their teenage daughters? Shine finds the standards of today's desperate housewives astonishingly low, and she has set out to teach women how they can be good mothers, look good, and feel good about the choices they make. Being a housewife does not mean you are on house arrest or can't be satisfied in your marriage. So step up, realize that you want to be home with your children, and embrace your life.",['Darla Shine'],Harper Collins,2009,['Self-Help'],2.0,5.0,2008-06-27,"YES, YES, YES!","Loved this book.

I'm tired of seeing SAHMs referred to or portrayed as Rich Women, when many make significant financial sacrifices to stay home. I'm tired of the idea that women who stay home have checked their identities, priorities, and brains at the door. This book is the antidote to all that.

Meet Stephanie Plum, a bounty hunter with attitude. In Stephanie’s opinion, toxic waste, rabid drivers, armed schizophrenics, and August heat, humidity, and hydrocarbons are all part of the great adventure of living in Jersey. She’s a product of the “burg,” a blue-collar pocket of Trenton where houses are attached and narrow, cars are American, windows are clean, and (God forbid you should be late) dinner is served at six. Out of work and out of money, Stephanie blackmails her bail-bondsman cousin Vinnie into giving her a try as an apprehension agent. Stephanie knows zilch about the job requirements, but she figures her new pal, el-primo bounty hunter Ranger, can teach her what it takes to catch a crook. Her first assignment: nail Joe Morelli, a former vice cop on the run from a charge of murder one. Morelli’s the inamorato who charmed Stephanie out of her virginity at age sixteen.

As a huge Nick Hornby fan, I was enthralled with the final product of the filmmakers. No ""let's move the script to Chicago"" debasing of the script, a la the Cusack-centric version of ""High Fidelity."" As good as the book is, ""About a Boy"" the movie is even better. It didn't seem possible.But even if you've seen the movie, and are thinking about the book, I suggest you give it a try. Especially if you've never read Hornby before. In fact, if you're 'new to Nick,' here's one man's take on a course of action...1. [Assumes you've just seen 'About a Boy.']2. Read the book.3. Rent 'Fever Pitch' from Blockbuster. [The book is rather a tough read - unless you're a European football (aka 'soccer') fanatic. It deals with Hornby's lifelong obsession with Arsenal & his struggles to become a writer. But the movie is a sweet little vignette drawn from the book. It makes for a nice viewing by a couple looking for a good Staurday night rental. Just ignore the odd cover box, which has nothing to do with the movie.]4. Read 'High Fidelity.' [Only see the movie if you've read the book first. Don't let the movie ruin the book for you.]5. Read 'How to Be Good.'---------Here are two neat little differences between 'About a Boy,' the movie and book, that I don't think will ruin the book for you:'Social Suicide' Song---------------------Movie: 'Killing Me Softly'Book: 'Both Sides Now'An inspired choice by the moviemakers.

Figure drawing,"Many of us want to learn “how to draw.” But as artist Anthony Ryder explains, it’s much more important to learn what to draw. In other words, to observe and draw what we actually see, rather than what we think we see. When it comes to drawing the human figure, this means letting go of learned ideas and expectation of what the figure should look like. It means carefully observing the interplay of form and light, shape and line, that combine to create the actual appearance of human form. In The Artist’s Complete Guide to Figure Drawing, amateur and experienced artists alike are guided toward this new way of seeing and drawing the figure with a three-step drawing method. The book’s progressive course starts with the block-in, an exercise in seeing and establishing the figure’s shape. It then build to the contour, a refined line drawing that represents the figure’s silhouette. The last step is tonal work on the inside of the contour, when light and shadow are shaped to create the illusion of form. Separate chapters explore topics critical to the method: gesture, which expresses a sense of living energy to the figure; light, which largely determines how we see the model; and form, which conveys the figure’s volume and mass. Examples, step-by-steps, and special “tips” offer helpful hints and practical guidance throughout. Lavishly illustrated with the author’s stunning artwork, The Artist’s Complete Guide to Figure Drawing combines solid instruction with thoughtful meditations on the art of drawing, to both instruct and inspire artists of all levels.",['Anthony Ryder'],Watson-Guptill,2014,['Art'],4.0,5.0,2011-06-01,Best purchase of the year!,"As probably many others who purchased this book I was working off of the PDFs that are readily available online.

Baby Whisperer Solves All Your Problems,"The most comprehensive, up-close, and personal book in the bestselling Baby Whisperer series to date! Thousands of parents have asked the Baby Whisperer to help them solve their problems. With this book you too can take advantage of the advice, insights, and parenting techniques from beloved child expert Tracy Hogg. “A problem is nothing more than a situation calling for a creative solution,” she reminds us. “Ask the right questions and you'll come up with the right answers.” Once you learn how to translate banguage, the “baby-language” your infant uses to communicate needs, feelings, and opinions, you can see your child for who he or she really is—an understanding that will serve you well as your child blossoms into the toddler years. By helping you establish a daily routine and tailor your parenting strategies according to your child's unique personality and stage of development, Tracy will teach you how to: • Ask the Twelve Essential Questions to recognize potential problems and employ the Twelve Principles of Problem Solving—simple troubleshooting techniques for everyday situations • Avoid, or remedy, accidental parenting—inadvertent adult behavior that often leads to such common parenting challenges as sleep problems, poor eating habits, separation anxiety, and tantrums • Be a P.C. parent—patient and conscious—who knows how to detect prime times—windows of opportunity for teaching babies how to get to sleep on their own, introducing bottles to breast-fed babies, toilet training, and other growth issues • Inhibit runaway emotions and foster his or her emotional fitness—the ability to understand and manage feelings ...and so much more. For Tracy's fans, this book will be a welcome addition to the Hogg library; for readers unfamiliar with her philosophy of care, it will open a new world of understanding and insight.","['Tracy Hogg', 'Melinda Blau']",Simon and Schuster,2010,['Family & Relationships'],2.0,5.0,2008-05-22,My Bible when I needed help!,"I loved this book! It was great to have a common sense source of ideas and information when your brains have fallen out following child birth.I had already bought, enjoyed and employed many of the 'teachings' in Tracy Hogg's first book and this book covers the same stuff but then goes into more detail, provides more in-depth information, more case studies, and ideas for what to do if it all feels like it's going wrong (even though it probably isn't and all you need is a bit of reassurance!!)I liked how it continues on from the previous book and covers more about sleep/feeding/behaviour issues with older babies too. Very helpful since my daughter seems to be growing up so fast!I liked the relaxed friendly tone it is written in and how her approach is less stern than other similar childcare advisors. Her child friendly approach combined with structure and routine suits my style of parenting (and perhaps my style has been influenced by the books??)This was definitely a valuable source of information that supported me as a first time Mom at a very challenging time...steep learning curve doesn't really cover it!As a result my child is a great eater and sleeper and is generally well behaved(!) and some of the credit has to go to Tracy Hogg and her book's influence.I would recommend this book to anyone who would like to parent with love and kindness, providing routine, structure and hopefully discipline!!!I also bought this for a friend as a baby shower gift, and it was a great hit!",1,2

Her characters are recycled from previous works, and the plots are the same. However, her writing was engaging, and though familiar (If you've read the Rocky Mountain series, you'll remember the twin boys who make a repeat appearance here with different names), the characters were poignant. The ending was the most disappointing, since I always enjoy Lori Wick's signature way of ending a series by fast forwarding a few years and tying up all the loose ends for all her characters. She did try to do that, but I felt a bit more time and words, for that matter, could have been spent on the epilogue. I felt a bit let down. It sort of felt like she just wanted to finish writing it, and get it published. This whole series has felt more like a money-maker project rather than &quot;I have this story in my head and I just can't wait to write it down&quot;. That's too bad, because I've seen what Lori Wick is capable of in the past. Try the Kensington Chronicles by Lori Wick if you want great romance and adventure.

And when he does, surprising things begin to happen ... In The Buddha, Geoff and Me Edward Canfor-Dumas brings all his skills to bear in an absorbing story of everyday city life, where the characters stand out with all their human strengths and weaknesses, and the ending brings Ed - and perhaps all of us? - a hope we didn't necessarily expect.

I did try to introduce Buddhism to non-buddhist friends but found difficultis in doing so. It was hard to unfold the Buddha's teaching the right way and at the right pace. This book definitely unfold them nicely, especially to those who grow up with the western way of thinking. The author was briliant to choose a novel-type story-telling to introduce such a deep, strange, ""scary"" philosphy to someone who is not quite familiar with buddhism (or even has wrong view of it).Unfortunately I have to agree with Mtn Mann's comment on the ""chanting"" part. The over selling of ""chanting"" is too pushy and somewhat deteriorates the wisdoms the book has built in the erlier chapters.Anyway, I have to salute the author for writing such a marvelous book. I am looking forward for similar books which introduce buddhism nicely to the newbee in different angle or approach (different tradition -- not just nichiren -- would be nice.)",0,0

Silver is mentored by Pew, the old lighthousekeeper who tells her that stories are light and the only way to make sense of the world, to truly see. The notion of storytelling is at the center of this sweet, moving, and poetic novel.Jeanette Winterson uses Lighthousekeeping as a playground for the notions of storytelling, light and dark, of personal history and factual history, of the way humans view themselves and their pasts, of the way others view them, of the way others perceive history, fictional and factual, and by the end of the book, she has even included the reader in her journey as a lover of stories. It is a beautiful and engaging and quite simply moved me to tears.If you are looking for a linear, plot-driven novel, you may be disappointed. The beauty of this novel is in the patterning, the attention to language and theme and the notion of storytelling as a story in itself.",10,10

Antonia Felix, looking back in Condi's lifeline, writes in a thrilling manner about the racial discrimination in the USA, about the university career of Condoleezaa [aged 26 professor at the Stanford University], about her ascent to the personal coach of the white-house-chief - so that every reader of this book, beside a necessary frowning, is able to reconstruct sections of the motives of Rices political acting.

Double Indemnity,"James M.

The scene that is set in the railroad track is one of the most important in this novella noir about love, deceit and betrayal. It is not impossible to make some connections between this mentioned dark and the dark side of the human soul.This is a short book and very fast, and, at the same time, very interesting. Cain makes his characters and plot very engaging and dry as well. There isn't much time for many descriptions and digressions. The writer is very matter-of-fact throughout the whole narrative, keeping focus on his story. And as a consequence, keeping his readers' eyes glued to the pages.The main characters are beautifully developed little by little as the story progress. As such they are able to surprise the readers -- since we don't know everything about them. And they really surprise us! By the end of the book they have gone through the most shocking transformations -- so have the readers' sensibility. This is a classic novel that will last forever.",2,2

I believe Dorian's horrid fate would never have existed if Lord Henry had not been introduced to him. Lord Henry put outrageous ideas into an innocent litte head, and should be noticed as the fault of all of Gray's actions. It just killed me that no one realized what was really happening! But besides that question of fault, it was a grade A book, that I would read again, but not without a dictionary by my side.

Yet time has left his on-the-field achievements and his greater legacy undiminished. His 373 career wins are still third highest in major league history. In this slim, gracefully written volume Philip Seib explores not only Mathewson's role in the game, but in the context of the larger society as well.Professional baseball at the dawn of the 20th century was still seen as a haven for rowdies. The college-educated Mathewson represented a new standard, one in harmony with President Theodore Roosevelt's affirmation of the active life. As America moved toward involvement in World War I under the idealistic Woodrow Wilson, Mathewson's willingness to serve was once again in synch with the mood of the era. When Matty stood against the corruption that infected the game in the late teens, it was a precursor to greed and scandals that seemed to dominate national life in the 1920s.Seib's book is a worthy tribute to a great player, and more significantly, a great man.--William C.

Most of their congregation are Mexicans who have previously been served by the Spanish catholic church, and Native American tribes - some of whom have embraced this new religion but many who have not. The plot line consists mainly of a series of vignettes describing the life of the two priests as they go about their work.Willa Cather writes in a simple, but graceful style much like the personalities of her two priests. It is worth reading this novel just for her descriptions of the austere beauty of the American southwest. Many great authors have an uncanny ability to write beautiful prose with what appears to be very straightforward language, and Willa Cather certainly fits that category. Some have complained that her characters lacked depth in this novel, and though at times they seem to take a back seat to the setting, I found both men to be rich, real, and well-fleshed out characters.

Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life,"Acclaimed around the world and a national best-seller, this is the definitive work on Che Guevara, the dashing rebel whose epic dream was to end poverty and injustice in Latin America and the developing world through armed revolution. Jon Lee Anderson’s biography traces Che’s extraordinary life, from his comfortable Argentine upbringing to the battlefields of the Cuban revolution, from the halls of power in Castro’s government to his failed campaign in the Congo and assassination in the Bolivian jungle. Anderson has had unprecedented access to the personal archives maintained by Guevara’s widow and carefully guarded Cuban government documents. He has conducted extensive interviews with Che’s comrades—some of whom speak here for the first time—and with the CIA men and Bolivian officers who hunted him down. Anderson broke the story of where Guevara’s body was buried, which led to the exhumation and state burial of the bones. Many of the details of Che’s life have long been cloaked in secrecy and intrigue. Meticulously researched and full of exclusive information, Che Guevara illuminates as never before this mythic figure who embodied the high-water mark of revolutionary communism as a force in history.",['Jon Lee Anderson'],"Grove/Atlantic, Inc.",2010,['Biography & Autobiography'],17.0,2.0,2000-11-29,"Overpacked, understuffed.

The book seems to be a series of adventures - Che helping lepers, Che on a motorcycle, Che and his revolutionary guerilla buddies - rather than an exploration into the evolution of one of recent history's most interesting people.If you want to actually know more about the guy, pick up some of the editions of his own journals.

By edict of the king, the mighty Scottish laird Alec Kincaid must take an English bride. His choice is Jamie, youngest daughter of Baron Jamison—a feisty, violet-eyed beauty. Alec aches to touch her, to tame her, to possess her...forever. But Jamie has vowed never to surrender to a man she considers a highland barbarian. Alec is everything Jamie’s heart has warned her against—an arrogant scoundrel whose rough good looks speak of savage pleasures.

This book is an ""easy"" read, unlike many of Virginia Woolf's other novels, and follows a conventional style. However, there is nothing conventional about her writing; I have yet to come across another novelist with her ability to touch on everyday life with such subtlety and nuance.

"Travels With Charley, In Search of America","A collectible 50th anniversary deluxe edition featuring an updated introduction by Jay Parini and first edition cover art and illustrated maps of Steinbeck’s route by Don Freeman A Penguin Classic In September 1960, John Steinbeck embarked on a journey across America. He felt that he might have lost touch with the country, with its speech, the smell of its grass and trees, its color and quality of light, the pulse of its people. To reassure himself, he set out on a voyage of rediscovery of the American identity, accompanied by a distinguished French poodle named Charley; and riding in a three-quarter-ton pickup truck named Rocinante. His course took him through almost forty states: northward from Long Island to Maine; through the Midwest to Chicago; onward by way of Minnesota, North Dakota, Montana (with which he fell in love), and Idaho to Seattle, south to San Francisco and his birthplace, Salinas; eastward through the Mojave, New Mexico, Arizona, to the vast hospitality of Texas, to New Orleans and a shocking drama of desegregation; finally, on the last leg, through Alabama, Virginia, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey to New York. Travels with Charley in Search of America is an intimate look at one of America's most beloved writers in the later years of his life—a self-portrait of a man who never wrote an explicit autobiography. Written during a time of upheaval and racial tension in the South—which Steinbeck witnessed firsthand—Travels with Charley is a stunning evocation of America on the eve of a tumultuous decade. This Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition also features French flaps and deckle-edged paper. For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines.

If I would have read this in High School I probably would not have ignored books for the last 10 years. I need more books like this one.",5,5
"October Men : Reggie Jackson, George Steinbrenner, Billy Martin, and the Yankees' Miraculous Finish in 1978","Recounts one of the great summers of baseball history, 1978--the year the Yankees won the World Series after a tumultuous season.",['Roger Kahn'],Houghton Mifflin Harcourt,2004,['Sports & Recreation'],2.0,4.0,2005-05-02,Collision At Home,"Roger Kahn writes a book about the 1976-1978 Yankee Baseball seasons. The book is a mixture of parallel biographies of Billy Martin,George Steinbrenner and Reggie Jackson. Kahn gives a good primer and sets up the story well. For the non New York baseball fan he explains well the Brooklyn Dodger, New York Giant legacy and shows the New York Yankee rivarly with them.The book might have been better if the entire focus was on the dyanmics of Billy, George and Reggie. Those characters had everything and reflected the currents of the 1970's. There was racism,big business, high salaries,large ego's .Instead Kahn detracts from the bio angle by digressing about New York Giant managers of 1905 !Kahn does not appear to be a Yankee fan at least in terms of his writing . He gives an objective look of the Yankees. In terms of dealing with the Red Sox swoon this book was written before last years' Yankee debacle . Kanh does not mercifully (and luckily in view of last years result) beat up the Red Sox. Kahn is a bit of a Billy basher and he does not mention once the Howie Spira -Dave Winfield scandal at all.This led to George's expulsion but Kahn does not find the room to mention this fact. In fact he praises the modern George Steinbreener.Kahn appears to be the most objective about Reggie . He praises the feats but shows the ego of the man. If you are a baseball fan you will probably enjoy this book. If you are a Met fan you should read this book.But if you are a Billy Martin guy you may think the writing is somewhat biased.Since 25 years have past this reviewer wished Kahn was a little more objective about Billy Martin and George.",1,1

Gladiator,"Aggressive, explosive, and boasting awesome athletic ability, Dan Clark rose to tremendous fame as Nitro on American Gladiators. He quickly emerged as the most popular cast member and became a reality television superstar. But a twenty-year affair with steroids led to a life of pissing blood, smuggling drugs, destroying hotel rooms, getting arrested, growing breasts, and lying bloodied in the street after a vicious fight with his best friend. This is Clark's riveting, fiercely candid account of his life, career, and steroid addiction. From an upbringing defined by tragedy and a difficult search for identity to tales of performing center stage at Madison Square Garden and bedding Playboy Bunnies and porn stars, Clark explores the price of fame, the pressure of stardom, and how the whole steroid-fueled fantasy finally imploded. What began in high school as a way to speed up recovery from injury rapidly turned into an all-consuming addiction. With selfdeprecating humor and a trove of incredible stories, Clark provides an eye-opening report on the dangers of steroids both obvious and hidden -- and offers his thoughts on why steroid use remains a persistent problem today.

Kushiel's Dart,"Fifty Shades of Grey meets Game of Thrones, Kushiel's Dart is the first in a triptych of beautifully constructed historical fantasies that combine passion, danger, great battles, and deep eroticism. The land of Terre d’Ange is a place of unsurpassing beauty and grace. It is said that the angels found the land and saw it was good... and the ensuing race that rose from the seed of angels and men live by one simple rule: Love as thou wilt. Phèdre nó Delaunay is a young woman who was born with a scarlet mote in her left eye and sold into indentured servitude as a child. Her bond is purchased by Anafiel Delaunay, a nobleman with a very special mission... and the first one to recognize who and what she is: one pricked by Kushiel’s Dart, chosen to forever experience pain and pleasure as one. Phèdre is trained equally in the courtly arts and the talents of the bedchamber, but, above all, in the ability to observe, remember, and analyze. Almost as talented a spy as she is a courtesan, Phèdre stumbles upon a plot that threatens the very foundation of her homeland. Treachery sets her on her path; love and honor goad her further and will take her to the edge of despair... and beyond. Hateful friend, loving enemy, beloved assassin; they can all wear the same glittering mask in this world, and Phèdre will get but one chance to save all that she holds dear. Set in a world of cunning poets, deadly courtiers, heroic traitors, and a truly Machiavellian villainess, this is a novel of grandeur, luxuriance, sacrifice, betrayal, and deeply laid conspiracies.

Hannibal,"#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • “Is it as good as Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs? No . . . this one is better.”—Stephen King, The New York Times Book Review You remember Hannibal Lecter: gentleman, genius, cannibal. Seven years have passed since Dr. Lecter escaped from custody. And for seven years he’s been at large, free to savor the scents, the essences, of an unguarded world. But intruders have entered Dr. Lecter’s world, piercing his new identity, sensing the evil that surrounds him. For the multimillionaire Hannibal left maimed, for a corrupt Italian policeman, and for FBI agent Clarice Starling, who once stood before Lecter and who has never been the same, the final hunt for Hannibal Lecter has begun. All of them, in their separate ways, want to find Dr. Lecter. And all three will get their wish. But only one will live long enough to savor the reward. . . .

Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War,"The Civil War is the American Iliad. Lincoln, Stonewall Jackson, Grant, and Lee still stand as heroic ideals, as stirring to our national memory as were the legendary Achilles and Hector to the world of the ancient Greeks. Within the story of our Iliad one battle stands forth above all others: Gettysburg. Millions visit Gettysburg each year to walk the fields and hills where Joshua Chamberlain made his legendary stand and Pickett went down to a defeat which doomed a nation, but in defeat forever became a symbol of the heroic Lost Cause. As the years passed, and the scars healed, the debate, rather than drifting away has intensified. It is the battle which has become the great ""what if,"" of American history and the center of a dreamscape where Confederate banners finally do crown the heights above the town. The year is 1863, and General Robert E. Lee and his Army of Northern Virginia are poised to attack the North and claim the victory that would end the brutal conflict. But Lee's Gettysburg campaign ended in failure, ultimately deciding the outcome of the war. Launching his men into a vast sweeping operation, of which the town of Gettysburg is but one small part of the plan, General Lee, acting as he did at Chancellorsville, Second Manassas, and Antietam, displays the audacity of old. He knows he has but one more good chance to gain ultimate victory, for after two years of war the relentless power of an industrialized north is wearing the South down. Lee's lieutenants and the men in the ranks, imbued with this renewed spirit of the offensive embark on the Gettysburg Campaign that many dream ""should have been."" The soldiers in the line, Yank and Reb, knew as well that this would be the great challenge, the decisive moment that would decided whether a nation would die, or be created, and both sides were ready, willing to lay down their lives for their Cause. An action-packed and painstakingly researched masterwork by Newt Gingrich and William Forstchen, Gettysburg stands as the first book in a series to tell the story of how history could have unfolded, how a victory for Lee would have changed the destiny of the nation forever. This is a novel of true heroism and glory in America's most trying hour.","['Newt Gingrich', 'William R. Forstchen']",Macmillan,2010,['Fiction'],7.0,5.0,2005-09-24,Gettysburg: A Novel Of The Civil War,"Very Educational and interesting book.

Healing With Whole Foods: Oriental Traditions and Modern Nutrition,"Used as a reference by students of acupuncture, Healing with Whole Foods is an invaluable guide to the theory and practice of Chinese medicine. With facts about green foods such as spirulina and blue-green algae and information about the ""regeneration diets"" used by cancer patients and arthritics, it is also an accessible primer on nutrition—and a inspiring cookbook with more than 300 mostly vegetarian, nutrient-packed recipes. The information on Chinese medicine is useful for helping to diagnose health imbalances, especially nascent illnesses. It's smartly paired with the whole-foods program: because the Chinese have attributed various health-balancing properties to foods, you can tailor your diet to help alleviate symptoms of illness. For example, Chinese medicine dictates that someone with low energy and a pale complexion (a yin deficiency) would benefit from avoiding bitter foods and increasing ""sweet"" foods such as soy, black sesame seeds, parsnips, rice, and oats. (Note that the Chinese definition of sweet foods is much different from the American one!) Pitchford says in his dedication that he hopes the reader finds ""healing, awareness, and peace"" by following his program. The diet is certainly ascetic by American standards (no alcohol, caffeine, white flour, fried foods, or sugar, and a minimum of eggs and dairy) but the reasons he gives for avoiding these ""negative energy"" foods are compelling. From the adrenal damage imparted by coffee to the immune dysfunction brought on by excess refined sugar, Pitchford spurs you to rethink every dietary choice and its ultimate influence on your health. Without being alarmist, he offers dietary tips for protecting yourself against the dangers of modern life, including neutralizing damage from water fluoridation. There's further reading on food combining, female health, heart disease, pregnancy, fasting, and weight loss. Overall, this is a wonderful book for anyone who's serious about strengthening his or her body from the inside out.",['Paul Pitchford'],North Atlantic Books,2003,['Health & Fitness'],8.0,5.0,2006-04-08,The Bible of Healing with Foods,"This book belongs on everyone's bookshelf or kitchen, and frankly, as a nutrition class textbook (if the education system ever breaks out of current nutrition teaching practices).

"500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Love","Low-fat or low-carb? A recent New York Times Magazine (July 7, 2002) cover story answered this question and said that Dr. Atkins was right all along, ""its not fat that makes us fat but carbohydrates."" Though the government has spent hundreds of millions of dollars in research trying to prove that fat is the cause of obesity, there has been a subtle shift in the scientific consensus over the past five years supporting what the low-carb diet doctors have been saying all along: if we eat less carbohydrates, we will lose weight and live longer. One of the toughest challenges of any diet is having enough variety and choices to keep the dieter from losing interest.

Lucky Man: A Memoir,"A funny, highly personal, gorgeously written account of what it's like to be a 30-year-old man who is told he has an 80-year-old's disease. ""Life is great. Sometimes, though, you just have to put up with a little more crap."" --Michael J. Fox In September 1998, Michael J. Fox stunned the world by announcing he had been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease--a degenerative neurological condition. In fact, he had been secretly fighting it for seven years. The worldwide response was staggering. Fortunately, he had accepted the diagnosis and by the time the public started grieving for him, he had stopped grieving for himself. Now, with the same passion, humor, and energy that Fox has invested in his dozens of performances over the last 18 years, he tells the story of his life, his career, and his campaign to find a cure for Parkinson's. Combining his trademark ironic sensibility and keen sense of the absurd, he recounts his life--from his childhood in a small town in western Canada to his meteoric rise in film and television which made him a worldwide celebrity. Most importantly however, he writes of the last 10 years, during which--with the unswerving support of his wife, family, and friends--he has dealt with his illness. He talks about what Parkinson's has given him: the chance to appreciate a wonderful life and career, and the opportunity to help search for a cure and spread public awareness of the disease. He is a very lucky man, indeed. The Michael J. Fox Foundation Michael J. Fox is donating the profits from his book to the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research, which is dedicated to fast-forwarding the cure for Parkinson's disease.

Coming to Jakarta: A Poem About Terror,A long poem looks at U.S. interference in Indonesia that led to a massacre,['Peter Dale Scott'],New Directions Publishing,1989,['Poetry'],1.0,5.0,2007-10-19,The Poetry of Terror,"Peter Dale Scott is a modern American hero. His forays into the dark world of deep politics and the functions of the Uber-State are extraordinary contributions to our understanding of how US hegemony has developed in the post war period, and particularly since the 1960s. The persuasive power of that writing is, apart from the argument, derived from meticulous research, the rechecking of sources and corroboration of factual claims by ample foot-noting (there were, for example, 117 pages of footnotes in The Road to 9/11). Coming to Jakarta is a poetic re-telling of Scott's personal, intellectual journey through the world of international political terror and complements his other body of work. It's a long poem, and much of it may prove inaccessible to readers unfamiliar with Scott's political writing or the historical subjects alluded to. That should not deter, but be accepted as an invitation to commune with one of the great political analysts of our time.",9,9

BRAVE COWBOY,"Imaginary adventures with Indians, wild animals, and outlaws keep a little cowboy busy.",['Joan Walsh Anglund'],Andrews McMeel Publishing,1959,['Juvenile Fiction'],1.0,5.0,2006-05-03,"Brave Author, Great Publisher","While other reviews will give you a plot synopsis and their reaction to the book, or a comparison with the movie, ""Lonely Are The Brave,"" I will limit my review to a few off the wall observations. First, I liked this book a lot and believe the adaptation by Dalton Trumbo to be one of the most faithful by any screenwriter. Often it is difficult not to think of the movie a book is based on while reading it (if you've seen the movie first). But Abbey is so good he made me forget I'd seen the movie and allowed me to lose myself in his words and story. So, a great book, well written, that didn't back away from some of the political hot potatoes most writers and publishers would rather avoid (draft dodging, property rights, etc.).Few books have made me cry at the end -- usually it's when I think of the time and money wasted on them. This one left me in tears because of a profound sense of loss of another kind, the loss of men such as John W. Burns, the loss of the maverick, the loss of a true voice of the west, and the loss of a west that we will never know except through books and movies.But one thing impressed me as much as the contents of the book -- its binding. Rarely does anyone discuss this, but I have to say that this edition is the best bound I've ever read. The spine was not stiff and the pages were very flexible allowing me to read one handed almost anywhere. If all paperbacks used this same binding, I wouldn't have to replace my often-read books every eight or nine years. So, from this perspective, the publisher is allowing Abbey's work a much longer life in one edition. Possibly a tribute to Abbey's philosophy, or merely a coincidence, either way I remain impressed by this. This may be the only paperback I own that I can pass to my grandson, as is, for his enjoyment in the future.",4,4

Over 200 entirely new entries, including visits to 28 countries like Lebanon, Croatia, Estonia, and Nicaragua, that were not in the original edition. There is an emphasis on experiences: an entry covers not just Positano or Ravello, but the full 30-mile stretch along the Amalfi Coast. Every entry from the original edition has been readdressed, rewritten, and made fuller, with more suggestions for places to stay, restaurants to visit, festivals to check out.

Mere Christianity,"In the classic Mere Christianity, C.S. Lewis, the most important writer of the 20th century, explores the common ground upon which all of those of Christian faith stand together. Bringing together Lewis’ legendary broadcast talks during World War Two from his three previous books The Case for Christianity, Christian Behavior, and Beyond Personality, Mere Christianity provides an unequaled opportunity for believers and nonbelievers alike to hear this powerful apologetic for the Christian faith.",['C. S. Lewis'],Harper Collins,2009,['Religion'],205.0,4.0,2003-05-12,"250 pages of text, 1000 pages of thought","Lewis&#65533;s Mere Christianity is an insightful and thought provoking classic work of Christian literature. This collection of World War II radio speeches retains the impact it had fifty years ago in Britain. Lewis, a layman of the Church of England, conveys issues debated by the greatest scholars and minds for centuries in a way simple enough to be understood by a young student. The quantity and quality of illustrations alone make the book worthwhile. The genius imagination of C.S. Lewis beautifully reduces difficult thoughts down to simple illustrations.Lewis begins with topics relating to all people everywhere such as morality, the conscience, and the ideas of evolution and creationism. Primarily using anecdotal evidence, Lewis logically progresses the reader from the belief in the existence of a god to belief in the God of the Bible. Christian topics like forgiveness, hope, faith, and the Trinity are addressed at the end of the book.The book&#65533;s goal is to present only the core and central Christian doctrines, what Lewis calls &#65533;mere&#65533; Christianity. As a result, issues relating to denominational division in the Christian church are intentionally omitted. In my opinion, however, many of the topics ignored in order to reach this mutual &#65533;mere Christianity&#65533; are far too important to be overlooked. I also believe Lewis should have used more quotations from the Bible to support his arguments.Lewis presents the Christian perspective in a book aimed at the skeptic, the atheist, and the fellow Christian. Mere Christianity caused me to re-evaluate the beliefs I hold and the way they are applied to my life.",1,4
Highlander in Love,"The Lockhart brothers' quest for an ancient family heirloom has proved fruitless...and an unpaid loan has left them indebted to their rival, Payton Douglas. With no recourse, the Lockharts offer Payton their most valuable commodity: their sister Mared's hand in marriage. Raised to despise the Douglas name, Mared outwardly agrees to the marital bargain for the sake of her family; secretly, she concocts a plan to ensure Payton will not wish to marry her. Seeing the handsome, virile laird Payton face-to-face, however, threatens a centuries-long enmity -- and awakens Mared's deepest desires. But she will not be swayed. Choosing to repay her family's debt by working as his housekeeper instead of wedding him, she finds herself inexorably drawn to the man she vowed to resist. Then a profound discovery changes everything....Now, no longer bound by a promise to her family, Mared must let her heart decide if the laird Payton is the enemy of past legend -- or if he holds the key to a future filled with a passion beyond her wildest dreams.",['Julia London'],Gallery Books,2014,['Fiction'],5.0,5.0,2005-07-27,fine amusing Highlander entry,"In spite of the Lockhart and Douglas families feud, Payton Douglas loans a large sum of money to his rivals. The Lockharts agree to repay within one year or their daughter Mared will marry Payton. To their shock and chagrin, the proud Lockharts cannot make remittance at the end of year so Mared will be their payment.Payton is pleased that they failed because he treasures the spirited Mared and looks forward to having her as his spouse. However, everyone knows that courting the cursed Mared means misfortune and probably death so no one has dared try until Payton.Mared knows the Douglas clan as horrid enemies so she does not want to take their surname as hers. She throws women at him to tempt him, and pretends to be simpleminded while incidents occur that would shake a lesser person now that the curse has been activated. Mared obtains a modification to the agreement; she will be his housekeeper for one year. When her family finds the heirloom and pays off the debt, she can go home, but if home is where the heart is, she belongs with Payton.The sequel to the fabulous HIGHLANDER IN DISGUISE and HIGHLANDER UNBOUND is a fun romantic historical tale starring the sister of the two heroes from the previous novels. Mared knows family honor demands she marry Payton, but accepts humiliation to pay the debt without sleeping with the enemy. Payton is patient with the woman he loves as she pulls stunts so he will send her packing but he refuses to allow a curse or a stubborn Scotswoman from achieving his objective of marrying his beloved.

Now in a VC Andrews book, that's not a bad thing. There are varying degrees of Andrews dementedness, and this book is pretty low on the scale, all things considered, especially since there's none of the incest Andrews is so famous for. It's kind of the literary version of a soap opera. Poor Audrina is so screwed up in the head. She doesn't know what day it is, how old she is, or why her parents will never love her as much as they did her older sister, also an Audrina. The first Audrina, who died nine years before the second Audrina was born, is better than the second at everything, and Audrina #1's shadow covers the whole house in darkness.In terms of a cast of characters living in the Whitefern house, we have: Audrina #2; her dad Damian who forces her to rock in a chair and try to ""catch"" her dead sister's gifts; her aunt Ellsbeth (Ellie) who an unwed mother and basically the maid in residence; her mom Lucietta (Lucky) who gave up her career as a musician to be with Damian and holds tea parties with Ellsbeth and a dead relative, whom they take turns speaking for; and finally Vera, her spiteful evil cousin who breaks bones constantly, lies, teases, and causes trouble everywhere she goes.Audrina suffers from ""swiss cheese memory"" and struggles to discover why she cannot remember her past, while dealing with members of her family, and later, people in the outside world. There is no one she can trust, and nothing seems to make sense. What I like best about My Sweet Audrina is that it is a standalone book. All of Andrews' other books are in a five book series format, and this is the only solo book. It's trashy, it's juicy, it's a mighty fun read!",2,2

It touches on Game theory, behavioral economics, and Decision theory. However, it is not a treaty in any of these areas. The author keeps his observations at a 10,000 feet high level. So, the book instead of being a dry tome for mathematicians is actually a very entertaining book for laypersons.The author touches on the many aspects where crowds provide superior judgments than individuals alone. Our civilization quietly depends on many such favorable situations, These include the capital markets in general, and the stock market in particular. But, it also includes Nielsen ratings, polls, voting records. Most of the time, in all these circumstances the many give a better assessment, valuation, or judgment than the individual. The author is quick to point out that this is not always the case. Markets experience stock market bubbles where the collective judgment becomes euphoric. However, year in year out and over decades, the stock market (representing the many) beats the majority of the investment pros hands down.The author is fascinated by the emergence of ""decision markets,"" including the Iowa Electronic Markets for betting on Presidential election outcome that has proven more accurate than the polls. Another such example is the tradesports website that does the same, including betting on sport events, media events, international politics events. These are perfect examples where the many gather their judgment through trading values thanks to the Internet. In general, it is uncanny how accurate these decision markets are. There is really something to the saying ""put your money where your mouth is.""In a nutshell, this is a very interesting and thought provoking book. It promotes democratic and decentralized decision making within corporations and government institutions. This makes good sense. The CEO or the President just can't hold that much information in their individual brains anyway. Instead, why not rely a lot more extensively on the collective wisdom generated by the aggregated sum of our own individual brilliance. Why not!",11,13

With this work, Ross proudly joins the ranks of folks like Frazetta, Wyeth(!) and maybe even Fredric Remington in his sense of drama, framing and colorful rendering.Waid's script is full of all the wonderfully geeky self important and self conscious hyperbole and ploting that makes illustrated novels so fun to read. I especially appreciated Waid and Ross' full realization that America's canon of superheroes is very much a part of world mythology and legend. Superman, Wonder Woman (I love Ross' depiction of this uber-Tuetonic sex goddess. Gone are the overtones of lesbianism and all too present is WW's athletic sexuality) are depicted here as gods on earth, worthy of addition to Valhalla and Mt. Olympus.Warner Brothers would be wise to employ Ross and Waid as screenwriters and designers to resurrect their moribound Batman franchise.Part of a graphic novel, or escapist film's lure has always been its ability to serve as a ticket to another place.

The Outsiders,"Celebrate the 50th anniversary (April, 2017) of a landmark coming-of-age American novel with a Penguin Classics edition featuring an introduction by Jodi Picoult, author of My Sister's Keeper. Nominated as one of America’s best-loved novels by PBS’s The Great American Read First published in 1967, S. E. Hinton's novel was an immediate phenomenon. Today, with more than eight million copies sold, The Outsiders continues to resonate with its powerful portrait of the bonds and boundaries of friendship. In Ponyboy's world there are two types of people. There are the Socs, the rich society kids who get away with anything. Then there are the greasers, like Ponyboy, who aren't so lucky. Ponyboy has a few things he can count on: his older brothers, his friends, and trouble with the Socs, whose idea of a good time is beating up greasers. At least he knows what to expect-until the night things go too far. For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date translations by award-winning translators.",['S. E. Hinton'],Penguin,2006,['Fiction'],2.0,5.0,2002-06-27,The Outsiders - A Timeless Read,"Even though S.E. Hinton's young adult novel, The Outsiders, was first published 35 years ago, it is timeless. Just like Romeo and Juliet, or West Side Story, it is a story of rivaling groups and the emotional and physical scars that the rivalry plays on the individuals of both sides. There is no love story, but the relationships among three recently orphaned brothers and their gang of greaser friends tells of deep attachments, love and hate.The story is told by fourteen year old Ponyboy who is the youngest of the Curtis boys. He reveals his opinions, insights and feelings towards the people and events going on around him. Throughout the story Ponyboy's sensitivity to the complexities of peoples thoughts, motivations, and actions, including his own, increases dramatically. As Ponyboy develops an understanding of his world, so does the reader develop an understanding of how a teenage mind works and grows.Hinton's greasers and socs (socialites) represent the cliques that forever seem to reign in middle and high schools. For this reason most readers will find it easy to relate to one or more of the characters. If the reader is an adult, like me, Ponyboy's revelations will shed some light on who some of those other kids in school were, and why they did what they did. For the teen reading the book for the first time,Ponyboy offers insights that might make the road they're travelling easier to understand now.If you have a teen in your home, don't show them the movie. Give them this book to read. They are sure to appreciate the gift.",9,11
Song of Solomon,"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • An official Oprah Winfrey’s “The Books That Help Me Through” selection • With this brilliantly imagined novel, the acclaimed Nobel Prize winner transfigures the coming-of-age story as audaciously as Saul Bellow or Gabriel García Márquez. Milkman Dead was born shortly after a neighborhood eccentric hurled himself off a rooftop in a vain attempt at flight. For the rest of his life he, too, will be trying to fly. As Morrison follows Milkman from his rustbelt city to the place of his family’s origins, she introduces an entire cast of strivers and seeresses, liars and assassins, the inhabitants of a fully realized Black world.",['Toni Morrison'],Vintage,2007,['Fiction'],60.0,4.0,1999-12-12,I hate to give it just four stars but...,"Song of Solomon fascinated me from the first page, but unfortunately my interest dropped off as it progressed. Loved the characterizations, and I am a fan of this author. In some ways, she can do no wrong because her worst book is not even most writers' best.My favorites of hers are The Bluest Eye and Beloved. The suspense and depth of both of these books were sustained right to the finish. They were, frankly, epic novels, and each of Morrison's books is very, very different from the others...talk about a great writer!However,Song of Solomon, I felt, deteriorated because it became too DIDACTIC. I like my fictional politics acted out; this book began to feel preachy. As a Jewish woman, I can understand why African American readers could be thrilled by this. We (African Americans, Jews, women) need outspoken champions of our struggles, and as a woman and a Jewish person I am always cheered at courageously radical protest that encompasses my personal/political concerns. However, GREAT (read: lasting) fiction generally does not do this. It subverts through action and seduction. If it's too blatant, it becomes more of a political tract than a novel, and often doesn't pass the test of time. (It's as if Morrison stopped writing the novel's story for a section of it in order to insert specific political ideas she wanted to make sure she got across.)However, if you had to choose between Danielle Steele or any Tony Morrison book, I would exhort you to choose the latter. You will learn about life, love, racism, and, finally, good writing.",10,12
Great Expectations,"Penguin Classics e-books give you the best possible editions of Charles Dickens's novels, including all the original illustrations, useful and informative introductions, the definitive, accurate text as it was meant to be published, a chronology of Dickens's life and notes that fill in the background to the book. This Penguin Classics edition of Great Expectations also includes Dickens's alternative ending to the novel. A terrifying encounter with an escaped convict in a graveyard on the wild Kent marshes; a summons to meet the bitter, decaying Miss Havisham and her beautiful, cold-hearted ward Estella; the sudden generosity of a mysterious benefactor - these form a series of events that change the orphaned Pip's life forever, and he eagerly abandons his humble origins to begin a new life as a gentleman. Dickens's haunting late novel depicts Pip's education and development through adversity as he discovers thetrue nature of his 'great expectations'.",['Charles Dickens'],Penguin UK,2003,['Fiction'],2.0,3.0,2007-02-02,The twists and turns of life,"Great works of English literature from the 1700s and 1800s shared one thing in common; twists and turns in the plot lines that are never fully exposed until the last lines of the book. Chief among these twists are reversals of fortune both good and bad. So goes this work of literature. Though read by many as children, I would consider it more worthy of young adults, as the text can be quite boring for anyone below their teens. Basically, the plot revolves around Pip, a boy who grows up poor in the care of his sister and apprenticed to a blacksmith; a blue collar job by any standard. But he comes into an inheritance which he gladly accepts, leaving behind his previous life. A second theme of this story is his awe and obsession over Estella, a pretty girl who he meets first when young and poor when she does not even see him, and later one when he is rich when she cannot look past him. This is the probably the part of the book best remembered; a boy infatuated with what he cannot get, only to re-encounter it on later on in life as something he might not want anymore.As a book, it is shorter than most of Dickens' work, and much easier to read. But it has less historical meaning, and to me, less exploration of social ills than his other works such as Oliver Twist and Great Expectations. The book focuses more on personal travails, and how relationships between individuals all depend on the where the individuals came from. The book is interesting enough, but not that exciting, and I would not consider it as a mandatory work for all students to read.",2,5

Anna Karenina,"The must-have Pevear and Volokhonsky translation of one of the greatest Russian novels ever written Described by William Faulkner as the best novel ever written and by Fyodor Dostoevsky as “flawless,” Anna Karenina tells of the doomed love affair between the sensuous and rebellious Anna and the dashing officer, Count Vronsky. Tragedy unfolds as Anna rejects her passionless marriage and thereby exposes herself to the hypocrisies of society. Set against a vast and richly textured canvas of nineteenth-century Russia, the novel's seven major characters create a dynamic imbalance, playing out the contrasts of city and country life and all the variations on love and family happiness. While previous versions have softened the robust and sometimes shocking qualities of Tolstoy's writing, Pevear and Volokhonsky have produced a translation true to his powerful voice. This authoritative edition, which received the PEN Translation Prize and was an Oprah Book Club™ selection, also includes an illuminating introduction and explanatory notes. Beautiful, vigorous, and eminently readable, this Anna Karenina will be the definitive text for fans of the film and generations to come.

It was one of the first books on the subject I read after my doctor told me I had early dry MD in one eye. I was terribly upset to be suddenly faced with a future totally different from what I'd expected. When I picked up the Mogk book, my attention ws immediately riveted by Dr. Mogk's description of her father's happiness and independence despite late-stage MD. This was what I needed to hear: that people could be happy and retain independence in the face of low vision. That very positive beginning is an excellent way to pull the reader into what for most people is an unfamiliar medical problem.As I read further, my first impression of &quot;Macular Degeneration&quot; as an invaluable resource for those who have the disease was reinforced. The Mogks approach the subject of MD from a problem-solving perspective as well as from a professional point of view and from Dr. Mogk's father's experience. The book is very well organized, and the appendices are chock full of good resources for readers to pursue.Dr. Mogk also discusses ongoing research, letting readers know there is a keen interest within the medical-scientific community in macular degeneration and other retinal diseases. As I read of the various efforts afoot, I felt a sense of hope that before too long there will be effective treatment for this devastating disease that affects one-third of those over 75 and also younger people.The message I came away with after finishing the book is that there IS life after MD, and it can be a good one. I enthusiastically recommend this book to everyone who has MD.",45,45
French Quarter,"Home to the notorious ""Blue Book,"" which listed the names and addresses of every prostitute living in the city, New Orleans's infamous red-light district gained a reputation as one of the most raucous in the world. But the New Orleans underworld consisted of much more than the local bordellos. It was also well known as the early gambling capital of the United States, and sported one of the most violent records of street crime in the country. In The French Quarter, Herbert Asbury, author of The Gangs of New York, chronicles this rather immense underbelly of ""The Big Easy."" From the murderous exploits of Mary Jane ""Bricktop"" Jackson and Bridget Fury, two prostitutes who became famous after murdering a number of their associates, to the faux-revolutionary ""filibusters"" who, backed by hundreds of thousands of dollars of public support—though without official governmental approval—undertook military missions to take over the bordering Spanish regions in Texas, the French Quarter had it all.

It combines elements of drama, comedy, suspense and adventure to bring your emotions to the surface. The book appeals to fans of the Fantasy genre of almost all ages. The grandfather-telling prose in which The Hobbit is written will appeal to adolescents while the sheer language, storyline and myths that Tolkien has created will surely entice the adult readers.In the opinion of this reviewer, no Fantasy fiction author gives as vivid depictions of all aspects of environments, characters and story as well as Tolkien. So much, in fact, that many popular authors since have tried to parallel Tolkien's writing style. The Hobbit (and The Lord of the Rings) is the echelon of every Fantasy book written since and should belong in every Fantasy liturature reader's library.This reviewer strongly recommends the 1997 edition of The Hobbit which marks the 60th anniversary of the first edition. The book is in beautiful hardcover format filled with lavishly painted illustrations by noted Norse myth artist Alan Lee. The illustrations serve as a wonderful supplement to an already well depicted story. The paper and typeface used in this particular edition is of the highest quality and will last for generations to come. It is wrapped nicely in a glossy paper sleeve, edged with gold foil on the top and bottom in which ancient runes of old are scribed. The sleeve is also adorned with one of the many beautiful paintings of Lee.In conclusion, please be sure to make it a point to read The Hobbit if you have not already done so.

Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices,"Have you ever wondered why we Christians do what we do for church every Sunday morning? Why do we “dress up” for church? Why does the pastor preach a sermon each week? Why do we have pews, steeples, and choirs? This ground-breaking book, now in affordable softcover, makes an unsettling proposal: most of what Christians do in present-day churches is rooted, not in the New Testament, but in pagan culture and rituals developed long after the death of the apostles. Coauthors Frank Viola and George Barna support their thesis with compelling historical evidence and extensive footnotes that document the origins of modern Christian church practices. In the process, the authors uncover the problems that emerge when the church functions more like a business organization than the living organism it was created to be. As you reconsider Christ's revolutionary plan for his church—to be the head of a fully functioning body in which all believers play an active role—you'll be challenged to decide whether you can ever do church the same way again.","['Frank Viola', 'George Barna']","Tyndale House Publishers, Inc.",2010,['Religion'],200.0,3.0,2005-12-29,A MUST READ though too brief!,"This is a MUST READ for any Christian questioning current Christian practices. Mr. Viola historically traces the steps which brought us to our current institutionalized churches and mindsets. The biggest detriment to this work is his position that our current institutionalized churches lack the ability to equip the saints and consequently stiffle the growth of its members and body yet institutionalized churches are larger in number than those which Mr. Viola participates. Mr. Viola needs to add examples and more proof to his positions (regardless if they are true). The reader must also realize that the underlying premise to Mr. Viola's arguement is: first century church practice is binding on the current church. With this in mind, we know that there are many first century church practices (i.e. examples) which even the author's church does not replicate. Thus, it becomes a shaky arguement to simply pick a few specks in other brother's churches and miss the own in his own eye. Reality is: God does chose individuals for His own plan and glory and we should not shirk from acknowledging God's special purpose for these few Christians and their amazing ability and accomplishments through Christ. Regardless, still a must read but not for those desiring to have an axe to grind with his own brothers and sisters in Christ.",13,16

On his 83rd birthday, a tragic accident kills him, as he tries to save a little girl from a falling cart. He awakes in the afterlife, where he learns that heaven is not a destination. It's a place where your life is explained to you by five people, some of whom you knew, others who may have been strangers.

Harry Potter & the Prisoner of Azkaban,"Through classroom activities, wizard rock concerts, and organizations like the Harry Potter Alliance, Harry Potter fans are using creativity to positively impact the world. This collection of essays and interviews examines how playful fandom--from fanfiction to Muggle quidditch, cosplay, role-playing games, and even Harry Potter burlesque--not only reimagines the canon but also challenges consumerism, questions notions of identity, and fosters participatory culture. The contributors explore issues applicable to fan studies and performance studies at large, such as the role of performance, the nature of community, and questions of representation and ownership in the digital age. Presented in three parts, the essays discuss discrepancies between sanctioned versions of Harry Potter and fan creations, the reenactment and reinterpretation of the original narrative in fan performance, and collaborative and participatory performances that break down the boundaries between actors and audiences.",['Lisa S.

One Child,"Sheila was wild, unreachable, abused--and a genius. She ws a child lost until a brilliant young teacher reached out.",['Torey L. Hayden'],HarperCollins UK,2004,['Abandoned children'],10.0,4.0,2001-11-27,One Child Review,"I read One Child by Torey L. Hayden. This book was mostly drama/young adult. One Child is a story of a teacher who instructs a class of children with serious problems, and who are very disturbed. The story tells of a various group of children (who've had it rough) growing together and growing up. The main focus is on one child in particular who touches the teachers heart. I've read many drama's and many young adult novels. I can't make any comparisons though because I have never read anything this heartfelt. So in a way the feelings and virtues that vibrate from this book are something that I have never encountered or experienced before. It was way more sentimental and serious than I expected. My personal feelings however were interperted very easily. While I was reading this book I was amazed at the describtiveness and the story. I got really into the book, to a point where I actually wanted to meet the characters. The book taught me a lot about friendship, and that people who are different are still people. &quot;'I didn't mean it when I said I would be bad. I'll be a good girl.' she looked up solemnly. 'For you.'&quot; Page 219. I loved this part because it was after Shelia had come back from the hospital and had realized that it was May and the school year was going to end. She had promised to return to her nasty old ways, and then at the last minute she changed. I love this part because it shows how one person can affect another so powerfully that they'd be willing to become a differnt person just for a friends sake. I enjoy the thought that people can change for the better just by making a single friend. All in all I just like to believe that everyone has a dream and that everyone has good in them. I really enjoyed this book, I really got into it and really felt its words. Although this was an exellent book it's not for everyone. It deals with some serious topics that a reader must be mature enough to handle. It also tells about children with disorders and handicaps that could be unsetteling to certain people. So I guess this book isn't for everyone but it taught me a lot and I enjoyed it.",0,2
Plain Heathen Mischief,"Of The Many Aspects of Mobile Home Living, Martin Clark’s first novel, the New York Times Book Review wrote, “Like Nick Hornby in High Fidelity and Thomas McGuane in Nothing But Blue Skies, Clark has produced an oddly stirring portrait of a man in existential disarray.” Which–noted Malcolm Jones in Newsweek–“made me laugh so hard I fell off the sofa.” Plain Heathen Mischief ups the existential ante, as Joel King, a defrocked Baptist minister, finds life even more bedeviling once he’s served six months for a career-ending crime he might not even have committed. Now his incommunicado wife wants a divorce, the teenage vixen of his disgrace is suing him for a cool $5 million, a fresh start in Montana offers no hope for ex-cons of any religious persuasion, and the refuge provided by his sister turns as nasty as his parole officer. Talk about a crisis of faith. On the upside, a solicitous member of Joel’s former congregation invites him into a scam that could yield some desperately needed cash, and soon the down-on-his-luck preacher is involved with a flock of charming con men, crooked lawyers, and conniving youth. In a feat of bravura storytelling, Martin Clark ranges from the cross to the double cross, from Virginia to Las Vegas, from jail cells to trout streams, as he follows his Job-like hero through dubious choices and high-dollar insurance hustles to a redemption that no reader could possibly predict. Wildly imaginative, at times comic, at times profoundly sobering, and even more audacious than his wonderfully idiosyncratic debut, Plain Heathen Mischief is a spiritual revelation of the first order.",['Martin Clark'],Vintage,2007,['Fiction'],3.0,4.0,2005-12-14,What else could happen?,"This is definitely the story of Job. I couldn't put the book down once I started it, but I kept thinking ""how can this guy be so gulible?"" As usual, I got into the characters and Joel (Job?) was someone I felt for. When I hear myself saying to a character, ""don't do it!"", I know I'm into the book. His sister, Sophie, was remarkably believable in her no-nonsense, out-of-patience take on life. Of course, if I had a brother like Joel, I'd be the same way. What a fun read. This would a good book for discussion in a book club.",1,1
Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance : An Inquiry into Values,"THE CLASSIC BOOK THAT HAS INSPIRED MILLIONS A penetrating examination of how we live and how to live better Few books transform a generation and then establish themselves as touchstones for the generations that follow. Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance is one such book. This modern epic of a man’s search for meaning became an instant bestseller on publication in 1974, acclaimed as one of the most exciting books in the history of American letters. It continues to inspire millions. A narration of a summer motorcycle trip undertaken by a father and his son, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance becomes a personal and philosophical odyssey into fundamental questions on how to live. The narrator's relationship with his son leads to a powerful self-reckoning; the craft of motorcycle maintenance leads to an austerely beautiful process for reconciling science, religion, and humanism. Resonant with the confusions of existence, this classic is a touching and transcendent book of life.

Because you're not, and maybe it will help you. If you said anything other than &quot;yes,&quot; avoid this book. The reader's guide to this book says that it has something for everybody. This is true. But something for everybody stinks when you think about it as an individual. Who cares what's there for others? What matters is what is there for one individual, and it isn't much. Less than one would get from a ten minute conversation with an intelligent person. For me, there was a section ranting about universities which I quite enjoyed. But that was about ten pages. Wasting hours of time on hundreds of useless pages is absurd. Reading the Tao, a motorcycle handbook, and a seriously flawed psychology textbook will provide far more insight and knowledge in far less time than this book possibly can.",9,27
Creation Regained: Biblical Basics for a Reformational Worldview,"with a Postcript coauthored by Michael W. Goheen In print for two decades and translated into eight languages, Albert Wolters's classic formulation of an integrated Christian worldview has been revised and expanded to reach new readers beyond the generation that has already benefited from this clear, concise proposal for transcending the false dichotomy between sacred and secular. Wolters begins by defining the nature and scope of a worldview, distinguishing it from philosophy and theology. He then outlines a Reformed analysis of the three basic categories in human history -- creation, fall, and redemption -- arguing that while the fall reaches into every corner of the world, Christians are called to participate in Christ's redemption of all creation. This Twentieth Anniversary edition features a new concluding chapter, coauthored with Michael Goheen, that helpfully places the discussion of worldview in a broader narrative and missional context. Praise for the first edition""This is the best statement I have come across of the 'reformational' Christian worldview. It is lucidly written, includes a lot of helpful analogies and illustrations, and is throughout generous in its spirit."" -- Nicholas Wolterstorff, Yale University""Translates the central insights and categories of the neo-Calvinist tradition into fresh, nontechnical language and clarifies them with a generous sprinkling of apt illustrations and images. . . . Highly recommended to all those desiring a crisp introduction to a Christian worldview in general or the neo-Calvinist tradition in particular."" -- ""Christian Scholar's Review""Outstanding. . . .

Granted he was a bit self centered and, at times, self congradulating, but his accomplishments were many. His wit is often stinging. I was surprised to read about his military activities and yet he was influenced by the Quakers. It's also significant that he talks of his belief in the deity and the fact that he was a presbetyrian.

The Bonfire of The Vanities,"An exhilarating satire of Eighties excess that captures the effervescent spirit of New York, from one of the greatest writers of modern American prose. Sherman McCoy is a WASP, bond trader and self-appointed 'Master of the Universe'. He has a fashionable wife, a Park Avenue apartment and a Southern mistress. His spectacular fall begins the moment he is involved in a hit-and-run accident in the Bronx. Prosecutors, newspaper hacks, politicians and clergy close in on him, determined to bring him down. Exuberant, scandalous and exceptionally discerning, The Bonfire of the Vanities was Tom Wolfe's first venture into fiction and cemented his reputation as the foremost chronicler of his age. 'The air of New York crackles with an energy that causes the adrenalin to pump... The feeling is perfectly reproduced in Wolfe's novel... Electric' Sunday Times 'The quintessential novel of The Eighties' The Guardian",['Tom Wolfe'],Random House,2018,['Fiction'],54.0,5.0,2003-05-21,New York's Greatest Portrayal,"Tom Wolfe has a magical touch for breathing life into non-fiction, as in The Right Stuff, but in Bonfire of the Vanities, his skill as a novelist and a satirist is blatantly evident. This bleak and witty portrayal of New York life in the eighties is both hilarious and dark at the same time. Wolfe's characters represent the spectrum of human behavior, while his situations are riddled with ironies and paradoxes of truth about human existence. This book is most enjoyable, I would imagine, if you have at least some knowlege of New York, because much of its humor and depth stems from New York culture, but it is also true that New york is a micrchosm of american existence on a whole, so Bonfire of the Vanities may, in fact, be a universally American Novel. Whichever, it is worth reading if not only for the reason that it is funny, brilliantly written, and makes clear the fact that Tom Wolf's name belongs on the list of satirists that includes Jonathon Swift and Oscar Wilde.",3,4

"Here, There and Everywhere: My Life Recording the Music of the Beatles","An all-access, firsthand account of the life and music of one of history's most beloved bands--from an original mastering engineer at Abbey Road Geoff Emerick became an assistant engineer at the legendary Abbey Road Studios in 1962 at age fifteen, and was present as a new band called the Beatles recorded their first songs. He later worked with the Beatles as they recorded their singles “She Loves You” and “I Want to Hold Your Hand,” the songs that would propel them to international superstardom. In 1964 he would witness the transformation of this young and playful group from Liverpool into professional, polished musicians as they put to tape classic songs such as “Eight Days A Week” and “I Feel Fine.” Then, in 1966, at age nineteen, Geoff Emerick became the Beatles’ chief engineer, the man responsible for their distinctive sound as they recorded the classic album Revolver, in which they pioneered innovative recording techniques that changed the course of rock history. Emerick would also engineer the monumental Sgt. Pepper and Abbey Road albums, considered by many the greatest rock recordings of all time. In Here, There and Everywhere he reveals the creative process of the band in the studio, and describes how he achieved the sounds on their most famous songs. Emerick also brings to light the personal dynamics of the band, from the relentless (and increasingly mean-spirited) competition between Lennon and McCartney to the infighting and frustration that eventually brought a bitter end to the greatest rock band the world has ever known.","['Geoff Emerick', 'Howard Massey']",Penguin,2006,['Biography & Autobiography'],15.0,5.0,2012-08-15,"Here, There and Everywhere",Great insightful view of Beatles in the studio.

The Fifth Discipline: The Art and Practice of the Learning Organization,"MORE THAN ONE MILLION COPIES IN PRINT • “One of the seminal management books of the past seventy-five years.”—Harvard Business Review This revised edition of the bestselling classic is based on fifteen years of experience in putting Peter Senge’s ideas into practice. As Senge makes clear, in the long run the only sustainable competitive advantage is your organization’s ability to learn faster than the competition. The leadership stories demonstrate the many ways that the core ideas of the Fifth Discipline, many of which seemed radical when first published, have become deeply integrated into people’s ways of seeing the world and their managerial practices. Senge describes how companies can rid themselves of the learning blocks that threaten their productivity and success by adopting the strategies of learning organizations, in which new and expansive patterns of thinking are nurtured, collective aspiration is set free, and people are continually learning how to create the results they truly desire. Mastering the disciplines Senge outlines in the book will: • Reignite the spark of genuine learning driven by people focused on what truly matters to them • Bridge teamwork into macrocreativity • Free you of confining assumptions and mindsets • Teach you to see the forest and the trees • End the struggle between work and personal time This updated edition contains more than one hundred pages of new material based on interviews with dozens of practitioners at companies such as BP, Unilever, Intel, Ford, HP, and Saudi Aramco and organizations such as Roca, Oxfam, and The World Bank.",['Peter M.

The land of Terre d’Ange is a place of unsurpassing beauty and grace. It is said that the angels found the land and saw it was good... and the ensuing race that rose from the seed of angels and men live by one simple rule: Love as thou wilt. Phèdre nó Delaunay is a young woman who was born with a scarlet mote in her left eye and sold into indentured servitude as a child. Her bond is purchased by Anafiel Delaunay, a nobleman with a very special mission... and the first one to recognize who and what she is: one pricked by Kushiel’s Dart, chosen to forever experience pain and pleasure as one. Phèdre is trained equally in the courtly arts and the talents of the bedchamber, but, above all, in the ability to observe, remember, and analyze. Almost as talented a spy as she is a courtesan, Phèdre stumbles upon a plot that threatens the very foundation of her homeland. Treachery sets her on her path; love and honor goad her further and will take her to the edge of despair... and beyond. Hateful friend, loving enemy, beloved assassin; they can all wear the same glittering mask in this world, and Phèdre will get but one chance to save all that she holds dear. Set in a world of cunning poets, deadly courtiers, heroic traitors, and a truly Machiavellian villainess, this is a novel of grandeur, luxuriance, sacrifice, betrayal, and deeply laid conspiracies. Not since Dune has there been an epic on the scale of Kushiel's Dart—a massive tale about the violent death of an old age and the birth of a new.",['Jacqueline Carey'],Tor Fantasy,2020,['Fiction'],118.0,5.0,2004-06-29,"Disliked at first, grew to love it.","I did not know much about the book before I began reading it, and at first I was annoyed about the political details within the story. I wanted more erotica! After a hundred pages, I was hooked on the whole story. It is a unique storyline and offers a look inside a rich, vibrant culture that is alive and unbelievably detailed. The story is woven intricately and you are left guessing where the plot will turn next. Aside from my initial irritation about the detailed political climate, the humanity brought to life by Carey in this novel is worth the time investment. I even grew to love the complex story that fed my creative mind.Of the three books in the series, this is by far my favorite. But if you read one, you're sure to read them all!",2,4
Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob,"Now a major motion picture starring Johnny Depp A New York Times Bestseller A Boston Globe Bestseller An ABA Indie Bestseller James ""Whitey"" Bulger became one of the most ruthless gangsters in US history, and all because of an unholy deal he made with a childhood friend. John Connolly a rising star in the Boston FBI office, offered Bulger protection in return for helping the Feds eliminate Boston's Italian mafia. But no one offered Boston protection from Whitey Bulger, who, in a blizzard of gangland killings, took over the city's drug trade. Whitey's deal with Connolly's FBI spiraled out of control to become the biggest informant scandal in FBI history. Black Mass is a New York Times and Boston Globe bestseller, written by two former reporters who were on the case from the beginning. It is an epic story of violence, double-cross, and corruption at the center of which are the black hearts of two old friends whose lives unfolded in the darkness of permanent midnight.","['Dick Lehr', ""Gerard O'Neill""]",PublicAffairs,2012,['True Crime'],8.0,4.0,2006-02-13,"Great, but a new one is needed","..that fills in the gaps! Take this case of a young man sucked up in this mess and see if it meshes with this book,which is a good read and very informative...The man was employed professionally and around the time Whitey split town was suddenly fired. Just before this an attractive woman had befriended him at Northeastern University, linked also to R Robert Popeo and Agent John Morris. When the man was fired the woman started suddenly taking mysterious trips and acting in a manner suggestive of infidelity while alleging marriage intentions. Before each mystery trip the man was treated with special kindness, as if to assuage guilt over the emotional betrayal soon to follow. This man had as a socil worker a woman who went by the name of a female FBI agent mentioned in Lehr's work on this topic. After Whitey fled, his prior employers blackballed him on job references and his car was tampered with a la Eddie Moiano. IRS audits and levies soon followed as well as sudden bank deposit discrepancies at Fleet Bank, which also harbored IRS accounts at the time. In addition the man's phone line indicated third party interception and screening. As part of this process, the man was called on job interviews which appeared to be nothing more than pretense interviews to gather information or desired evidence on the man. For example, the man was called to a software company offering real-time monitoring and messaging capability such as for chats.When he got there no one knew him or why he was there; but a waist level camera pointed down at him seated in the reception area garnered his photo. Prior to the interview, the man had received overlaid spiteful messages during online chats visible only to him- an alleged capability of this software.At other companies videos were made of him or handwriting samples obtained. Following the alleged fiancee, several other women with similar behavior patterns emerged while new male friends appeared on the scene indicating later after a befriending period that they had kept notebooks on the man or had watched him go to the health club,do banking etc. The man had no criminal history and did not know any principles in the Bulger case but was later informed by these suspicious new friends that he was to blame for the Bulger fiasco. Dan Burton was unavilable for comment on the man during the congressional hearings.The man received threatening and harassing calls but local police were unable to help. Why all of this? Prior to all this, the man had been featured in a local newspaper story detailing his search for who his father was and all the obstacles stemming from that.",4,8
The Story of the Trapp Family Singers,"With nearly 1,500 Broadway performances, six Tony Awards, more than three million albums sold, and five Academy Awards, The Sound of Music, based on the lives of Maria, the baron, and their singing children, is as familiar to most of us as our own family history. But much about the real-life woman and her family was left untold. Here, Baroness Maria Augusta Trapp tells in her own beautiful, simple words the extraordinary story of her romance with the baron, their escape from Nazi-occupied Austria, and their life in America. Now with photographs from the original edition.",['Maria A. Trapp'],Harper Collins,2011,['Biography & Autobiography'],16.0,5.0,2003-01-13,A powerful woman,"In the late 1960s, when I was maybe 9 years old, my mother let me ditch school to attend a lecture by Maria von Trapp. I'm guessing that the author was promoting a newer edition of her book at the time. She struck me as an opinionated, very strong personality, but one who had twinkling eyes and who encouraged me to continue my piano lessons. The baroness autographed my EZ-Play &quot;Sound of Music&quot; piano book, but sternly made sure that I realized that the movie was not REALLY what her life was about--that it was just Hollywood stuff. When I grew up and became a music teacher myself for 15 years, I wish I'd remembered this book, because I would have recommended it to every student of mine. I just found this copy in an antique shop, but THIS one won't be recycled or resold!What comes through on every page is the dedication to a will and purpose higher than any human's will. This was not meant to be a &quot;religious&quot; book, but a history of a family who made a huge difference in the world by their faithful service to God. Being willing to work hard, submit their discomfort or inconvenience to God's will and have Him turn it into great blessings and lessons for the family and indeed the world, are truly building blocks of faith, hope, love, and encouragement.In addition, the stories of the family's dedication to their profession and the pursuit of excellence are inspiring. To attain such stature and not have one's nose in the clouds is an accomplishment in itself! (Ever meet a music scholar or highly-educated performer? The humble ones are few and far between.)I agree with the other reviewers that Maria probably was the Captain of the family, but look what happened to a country peasant girl who was truly noble, not just assigned the title!",10,11

This is what Bilbo Baggins from The Hobbit is trying to do. This exciting tale is written by J.R.R. Tolkien. Meticulous Bilbo goes through many challenges to get his gold, and has many near death experiences. The protagonist in this story is viewed through third person, or narrator form.This hobbit, being so little, having big padded feet, and curly hair as they all do, must face many challenges. One of them is meeting Gollum, a horrible, sneaky little creature who lives back in the caves of the goblins. First, the dwarves that are with Bilbo and of course Bilbo himself are running from the goblins where he is knocked out. Second, when he wakes up he finds a ring and decides to go looking for the others. After walking quite a ways in the darkness he steps into something cold. At this time he meets Gollum. This creature then makes a deal with him...If Biblo wins a riddle game, Gollum won't eat him... if Bilbo doesn't win the game Gollum will eat him. Do you think Gollum is going to play a trick, or as Gollum would say, ""play a tricksy"" on Bilbo?Another exciting part is when Bilbo is like a kidnapper during the story. Bilbo is on the verge of being caught when he thinks up a plan to help his crew that he is with to get the treasure. He must get each of them and help them out of being captured. His plan is to get into barrels left over from food and drinks that are put into a river. Then they are floated to near the crew's destination. Will they make it?Ladies and gentlemen invite you to read The Hobbit. It is a wonderful book, and I encourage you to read it.

Le Guin'],Houghton Mifflin Harcourt,2012,['Juvenile Fiction'],163.0,3.0,2004-07-31,Good YA fantasty novel....no more than that,"A Wizard of EarthSea is one of the first fantasy novels written. She wrote around the same time that J.R.R. Tolkien and Roger Zelazney, founders of the fantasty genre, wrote. This book is written on a lower level of reading as like those found in the young adult/teen section of a library or Barnes and Noble bookstore. Even still, I respect it because it was one of the first fantasy novels, and the modern so-called fantasy novels are really just copies and imitations of what has already been written. This is a series of, I believe, five books. It has some good ideas that could be used in a comprehensive background of magic and its properties. One such idea is that everything has a true name in the Old Speech. This idea is the basis of illusion. If a rock seemingly turns into a diamond, its essence, so to speak, or true name is still a rock. The 'diamond' is an illusion. Overall, this book is entertaining and has a lot of good ideas about magic and heroes, but it is written on a lower level of reading and I wasn't thrilled with the plot. It does have well-done maps and an interesting world in which Sparrowhawk, or his true name/Old Speech name: Ged, travels. It is complete with different cultures and languages. le Guin deserves to be recognized as another founder of fantasty, although I don't believe she is as good as the two stated earlier in the paragraph.",4,9
